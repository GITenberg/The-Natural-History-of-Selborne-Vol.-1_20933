5</span>INTRODUCTION.</h2>
<p>Gilbert White was born in the village of Selborne on the 18th of July, 
in the year 1720.&nbsp; His father was a gentleman of good means, with a 
house at Selborne and some acres of land.&nbsp; Gilbert had his school 
training at Basingstoke, from Thomas Warton, the father of the poet of that
name, who was born at Basingstoke in 1728, six years younger than his 
brother Joseph, who had been born at Dunsford, in Surrey.&nbsp; Thomas 
Warton, their father, was the youngest of three sons of a rector of 
Breamore, in the New Forest, and the only son of the three who was not deaf
and dumb.&nbsp; This Thomas, the elder, was an able man, who obtained a 
fellowship at Magdalen College, Oxford, became vicar of Basingstoke, in 
Hampshire, and was there headmaster of the school to which young Gilbert 
White was sent.&nbsp; He was referred to in Amhurst&rsquo;s 
&ldquo;Terr&aelig; Filius&rdquo; as &ldquo;a reverend poetical 
gentleman;&rdquo; he knew Pope, and had credit enough for his verse to hold
the office of Professor of Poetry at Oxford from 1718 to 1728.&nbsp; His 
genius for writing middling verse passed on to his <!-- page 6--><a 
name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>more famous sons, Joseph 
and Thomas, and they both became in due time Oxford Professors of 
Poetry.</p>
<p>Gilbert White passed on from school to Oxford, where he entered Oriel 
College in 1739.&nbsp; He became a Fellow of Oriel, graduated M.A. in 1746,
at the age of six-and-twenty, and six years afterwards he served as one of 
the Senior Proctors of the University.&nbsp; His love of nature grew with 
him from boyhood, and was associated with his earliest years of home.&nbsp;
His heart abided with his native village.&nbsp; When he had taken holy 
orders he could have obtained college livings, but he cared only to go back
to his native village, and the house in which he was born, paying a yearly 
visit to Oxford, and in that house, after a happy life that extended a few 
years over the threescore and ten, he died on the 26th of June, 1793.</p>
<p>Gilbert White never married, but lived in peaceful performance of light 
clerical duties and enjoyment of those observations of nature which his 
book records.&nbsp; His brothers, who shared his love of nature, aided 
instead of thwarting him in his studies of the natural history of Selborne,
and as their lives were less secluded and they did not remain unmarried, 
they provided him with a family of young people to care about, for he lived
to register the births of sixty-three nephews and nieces.</p>
<p>It was one of his brothers, who was a member of the Royal Society, by 
whom Gilbert White was persuaded, towards the close of his life, to gather 
his <!-- page 7--><a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
7</span>notes into a book.&nbsp; It was first published in a quarto volume 
in the year of the outbreak of the French Revolution with the fall of the 
Bastile.&nbsp; He was more concerned with the course of events in a 
martin&rsquo;s nest than with the crash of empires, and no man ever made 
more evident the latent power of enjoyment that is left dead by those who 
live uneventful lives surrounded by a world of life and change and growth 
which they want eyes to see.&nbsp; Gilbert White was in his seventieth year
when his book appeared, four years before his death.&nbsp; It was compiled 
from letters addressed to Thomas Pennant and the Hon. Daines 
Barrington.</p>
<p>Thomas Pennant was a naturalist six years younger than Gilbert 
White.&nbsp; He was born at Downing, in Flintshire, in 1726, and died in 
1798, like White, in the house in which he had been born.&nbsp; His love of
Natural History made him a traveller at home and abroad.&nbsp; He counted 
Buffon among his friends.&nbsp; He had written many books before the date 
of the publication of White&rsquo;s &ldquo;Selborne.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
Pennant&rsquo;s &ldquo;British Zoology,&rdquo; his &ldquo;History of 
Quadrupeds&rdquo; and &ldquo;Arctic Zoology,&rdquo; had a high 
reputation.&nbsp; He wrote also a Tour in Wales and a History of 
London.</p>
<p>Daines Barrington, fourth son of the first Viscount Barrington, was a 
year younger than Pennant, and died in 1800.&nbsp; He became Secretary to 
Greenwich Hospital, a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries, and President 
of the Royal Society.&nbsp; His &ldquo;Miscellanies,&rdquo; <!-- page 
8--><a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>published in 4to 
in 1781, deal with questions of Natural History, and of Antiquities, 
including a paper first published in 1775 asserting the possibility of 
approaching the North Pole.&nbsp; His most valued book was one of 
&ldquo;Observations on the more Ancient Statutes.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>LETTERS ADDRESSED TO THOMAS PENNANT, ESQ.</h2>
<h3><!-- page 9--><a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
9</span>LETTER I.</h3>
<p>The parish of Selborne lies in the extreme eastern corner of the county 
of Hampshire, bordering on the county of Sussex, and not far from the 
county of Surrey; is about fifty miles south-west of London, in latitude 
fifty-one, and near mid-way between the towns of Alton and 
Petersfield.&nbsp; Being very large and extensive, it abuts on twelve 
parishes, two of which are in Sussex, viz., Trotton and Rogate.&nbsp; If 
you begin from the south and proceed westward, the adjacent parishes are 
Emshot, Newton Valence, Faringdon, Hartley Mauduit, Great Ward le Ham, 
Kingsley, Hadleigh, Bramshot, Trotton, Rogate, Lyffe, and Greatham.&nbsp; 
The soils of this district are almost as various and diversified as the 
views and aspects.&nbsp; The high part of the south-west consists of a vast
hill of chalk, rising three hundred feet above the village, and is divided 
into a <!-- page 10--><a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
10</span>sheep-down, the high wood and a long hanging wood, called The 
Hanger.&nbsp; The covert of this eminence is altogether <i>beech</i>, the 
most lovely of all forest trees, whether we consider its smooth rind or 
bark, its glossy foliage, or graceful pendulous boughs.&nbsp; The down, or 
sheep-walk, is a pleasing, park-like spot, of about one mile by half that 
space, jutting out on the verge of the hill-country, where it begins to 
break down into the plains, and commanding a very engaging view, being an 
assemblage of hill, dale, wood-lands, heath, and water.&nbsp; The prospect 
is bounded to the south-east and east by the vast range of mountains&nbsp; 
called the Sussex Downs, by Guild-down near Guildford, and by the Downs 
round Dorking, and Ryegate in Surrey, to the north-east, which altogether, 
with the country beyond Alton and Farnham, form a noble and extensive 
outline.</p>
<p>At the foot of this hill, one stage or step from the uplands, lies the 
village, which consists of one single straggling street, three-quarters of 
a mile in length, in a sheltered vale, and running parallel with the 
Hanger.&nbsp; The houses are divided from the hill by a vein of stiff clay 
(good wheat land), yet stand on a rock of white stone, little in appearance
removed from chalk; but seems so far from being calcareous, that it endures
extreme heat.&nbsp; Yet that the freestone still preserves somewhat that is
analogous to chalk, is plain from the <!-- page 11--><a 
name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>beeches, which descend 
as low as those rocks extend, and no farther, and thrive as well on them, 
where the ground is steep, as on the chalks.</p>
<p>The cart-way of the village divides, in a remarkable manner, two very 
incongruous soils.&nbsp; To the south-west is a rank clay, that requires 
the labour of years to render it mellow; while the gardens to the 
north-east, and small enclosures behind, consist of a warm, forward, 
crumbling mould, called black malm, which seems highly saturated with 
vegetable and animal manure; and these may perhaps have been the original 
site of the town; while the woods and coverts might extend down to the 
opposite bank.</p>
<p>At each end of the village, which runs from south-east to north-west, 
arises a small rivulet: that at the north-west end frequently fails; but 
the other is a fine perennial spring, little influenced by drought or wet 
seasons, called Well-head.&nbsp; This breaks out of some high grounds 
joining to Nore Hill, a noble chalk promontory, remarkable for sending 
forth two streams into two different seas.&nbsp; The one to the south 
becomes a branch of the Arun, running to Arundel, and so sailing into the 
British Channel: the other to the north.&nbsp; The Selborne stream makes 
one branch of the Wey; and, meeting the Black-down stream at Hadleigh, and 
the Alton and Farnham stream at Tilford-bridge, swells into a considerable 
river, navigable at Godalming; <!-- page 12--><a name="page12"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 12</span>from whence it passes to Guildford, and so into
the Thames at Weybridge; and thus at the Nore into the German Ocean.</p>
<p>Our wells, at an average, run to about sixty-three foot, and when sunk 
to that depth seldom fail; but produce a fine limpid water, soft to the 
taste, and much commended by those who drink the pure element, but which 
does not lather well with soap.</p>
<p>To the north-west, north and east of the village, is a range of fair 
enclosures, consisting of what is called a white malm, a sort of rotten or 
rubble stone, which, when turned up to the frost and rain, moulders to 
pieces, and becomes manure to itself.</p>
<p>Still on to the north-east, and a step lower, is a kind of white land, 
neither chalk nor clay, neither fit for pasture nor for the plough, yet 
kindly for hops, which root deep in the freestone, and have their poles and
wood for charcoal growing just at hand.&nbsp; The white soil produces the 
brightest hops.</p>
<p>As the parish still inclines down towards Wolmer Forest, at the juncture
of the clays and sand the soil becomes a wet, sandy loam, remarkable for 
timber, and infamous for roads.&nbsp; The oaks of Temple and Black-moor 
stand high in the estimation of purveyors, and have furnished much naval 
timber; while the trees on the freestone grow large, but are what workmen 
call shaky, and so brittle as often to fall to pieces in sawing.&nbsp; <!--
page 13--><a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>Beyond the
sandy loam the soil becomes a hungry, lean sand, till it mingles with the 
forest; and will produce little without the assistance of lime and 
turnips.</p>
<h3>LETTER II.</h3>
<p>In the court of Norton farmhouse, a manor farm to the north-west of the 
village, on the white malms, stood within these twenty years a broad-leaved
elm, or wych hazel, <i>ulmus folio latissimo scabro</i> of Ray, which, 
though it had lost a considerable leading bough in the great storm in the 
year 1703, equal to a moderate tree, yet, when felled, contained eight 
loads of timber; and, being too bulky for a carriage, was sawn off at seven
feet above the butt, where it measured near eight feet in the 
diameter.&nbsp; This elm I mention to show to what a bulk planted elms may 
attain; as this tree must certainly have been such from its situation.</p>
<p>In the centre of the village, and near the church, is a square piece of 
ground surrounded by houses, and vulgarly called &ldquo;The 
Plestor.&rdquo;&nbsp; In the midst of this spot stood, in old times, a vast
oak, with a short squat body, and huge horizontal arms extending almost to 
the extremity of the area.&nbsp; This venerable tree, <!-- page 14--><a 
name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>surrounded with stone 
steps, and seats above them, was the delight of old and young, and a place 
of much resort in summer evenings; where the former sat in grave debate, 
while the latter frolicked and danced before them.&nbsp; Long might it have
stood, had not the amazing tempest in 1703 overturned it at once, to the 
infinite regret of the inhabitants, and the vicar, who bestowed several 
pounds in setting it in its place again: but all his care could not avail; 
the tree sprouted for a time, then withered and died.&nbsp; This oak I 
mention to show to what a bulk planted oaks also may arrive: and planted 
this tree must certainly have been, as will appear from what will be said 
farther concerning this area, when we enter on the antiquities of 
Selborne.</p>
<p>On the Blackmoor estate there is a small wood called Losel&rsquo;s, of a
few acres, that was lately furnished with a set of oaks of a peculiar 
growth and great value; they were tall and taper-like firs, but standing 
near together had very small heads, only a little brush without any large 
limbs.&nbsp; About twenty years ago the bridge at the Toy, near Hampton 
Court, being much decayed, some trees were wanted for the repairs that were
fifty feet long without bough, and would measure twelve inches diameter at 
the little end.&nbsp; Twenty such trees did a purveyor find in this little 
wood, with this advantage, that many of them answered the <!-- page 15--><a
name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>description at sixty 
feet.&nbsp; These trees were sold for twenty pounds apiece.</p>
<p>In the centre of this grove there stood an oak, which, though shapely 
and tall on the whole, bulged out into a large excrescence about the middle
of the stem.&nbsp; On this a pair of ravens had fixed their residence for 
such a series of years, that the oak was distinguished by the title of the 
Raven Tree.&nbsp; Many were the attempts of the neighbouring youths to get 
at this eyry: the difficulty whetted their inclinations, and each was 
ambitious of surmounting the arduous task.&nbsp; But when they arrived at 
the swelling, it jutted out so in their way, and was so far beyond their 
grasp, that the most daring lads were awed, and acknowledged the 
undertaking to be too hazardous: so the ravens built on, nest upon nest, in
perfect security, till the fatal day arrived in which the wood was to be 
levelled.&nbsp; It was in the month of February, when these birds usually 
sit.&nbsp; The saw was applied to the butt, the wedges were inserted into 
the opening, the woods echoed to the heavy blow of the beetle or mall or 
mallet, the tree nodded to its fall; but still the dam sat on.&nbsp; At 
last, when it gave way, the bird was flung from her nest, and, though her 
parental affection deserved a better fate, was whipped down by the twigs 
which brought her dead to the ground.</p>
<h3><!-- page 16--><a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
16</span>LETTER III.</h3>
<p>The fossil-shells of this district, and sorts of stone, such as have 
fallen within my observation, must not be passed over in silence.&nbsp; And
first I must mention, as a great curiosity, a specimen that was ploughed up
in the chalky fields, near the side of the Down, and given to me for the 
singularity of its appearance, which, to an incurious eye, seems like a 
petrified fish of about four inches long, the cardo passing for a head and 
mouth.&nbsp; It is in reality a bivalve of the Linn&aelig;an Genus of 
Mytilus, and the species of Crista Galli; called by Lister, 
<i>Rastellum</i>; by Rumphius, <i>Ostreum plicatum minus</i>; by 
D&rsquo;Argenville, <i>Auris Porci</i>, s. <i>Crista Galli</i>; and by 
those who make collections, Cock&rsquo;s Comb.&nbsp; Though I applied to 
several such in London, I never could meet with an entire specimen; nor 
could I ever find in books any engraving from a perfect one.&nbsp; In the 
superb museum at Leicester House, permission was given me to examine for 
this article; and, though I was disappointed as to the fossil, I was highly
gratified with the sight of several of the shells themselves in high 
preservation.&nbsp; This bivalve is only known to inhabit the Indian Ocean,
where it fixes itself to a zoophyte, known by the name Gorgonia.&nbsp; The 
curious foldings of the suture the one into <!-- page 17--><a 
name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>the other, the 
alternate flutings or grooves, and the curved form of my specimen, are much
easier expressed by the pencil than by words.</p>
<p><i>Cornua Ammonis</i> are very common about this village.&nbsp; As we 
were cutting an inclining path up the Hanger, the labourers found them 
frequently on that steep, just under the soil, in the chalk, and of a 
considerable size.&nbsp; In the lane above Wall-head, in the way to Emshot,
they abound in the bank in a darkish sort of marl, and are usually very 
small and soft; but in Clay&rsquo;s Pond, a little farther on, at the end 
of the pit, where the soil is dug out for manure, I have occasionally 
observed them of large dimensions, perhaps fourteen or sixteen inches in 
diameter.&nbsp; But as these did not consist of firm stone, but were formed
of a kind of terra lapidosa, or hardened clay, as soon as they were exposed
to the rains and frost they mouldered away.&nbsp; These seemed as if they 
were a very recent production.&nbsp; In the chalk-pit, at the north-west 
end of the Hanger, large nautili are sometimes observed.</p>
<p>In the very thickest strata of our freestone, and at considerable 
depths, well-diggers often find large scallops or pectines, having both 
shells deeply striated, and ridged and furrowed alternately.&nbsp; They are
highly impregnated with, if not wholly composed of, the stone of the 
quarry.</p>
<h3><!-- page 18--><a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
18</span>LETTER IV.</h3>
<p>As in a former letter the freestone of this place has been only 
mentioned incidentally, I shall here become more particular.</p>
<p>This stone is in great request for hearth-stones, and the beds of ovens;
and in lining of lime-kilns it turns to good account, for the workmen use 
sandy loam instead of mortar, the sand of which fluxes, and runs by the 
intense heat, and so cases over the whole face of the kiln with a strong 
vitrified coat-like glass, that it is well preserved from injuries of 
weather, and endures thirty or forty years.&nbsp; When chiseled smooth, it 
makes elegant fronts for houses, equal in colour and grain to Bath stone; 
and superior in one respect, that, when seasoned, it does not scale.&nbsp; 
Decent chimney-pieces are worked from it of much closer and finer grain 
than Portland, and rooms are floored with it, but it proves rather too soft
for this purpose.&nbsp; It is a freestone cutting in all directions, yet 
has something of a grain parallel with the horizon, and therefore should 
not be surbedded, but laid in the same position that it grows in the 
quarry.&nbsp; On the ground abroad this firestone will not succeed for 
pavements, because, probably some degrees of saltness prevailing within it,
the rain tears the slabs to pieces.&nbsp; Though this stone is too hard to 
<!-- page 19--><a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>be 
acted on by vinegar, yet both the white part, and even the blue rag, 
ferments strongly in mineral acids.&nbsp; Though the white stone will not 
bear wet, yet in every quarry at intervals there are thin strata of blue 
rag, which resist rain and frost, and are excellent for pitching of 
stables, paths, and courts, and for building of dry walls against banks, a 
valuable species of fencing much in use in this village, and for mending of
roads.&nbsp; This rag is rugged and stubborn, and will not hew to a smooth 
face, but is very durable; yet, as these strata are shallow and lie deep, 
large quantities cannot be procured but at considerable expense.&nbsp; 
Among the blue rags turn up some blocks tinged with a stain of yellow or 
rust colour, which seem to be nearly as lasting as the blue; and every now 
and then balls of a friable substance, like rust of iron, called rust 
balls.</p>
<p>In Wolmer Forest I see but one sort of stone, called by the workmen 
sand, or forest-stone.&nbsp; This is generally of the colour of rusty iron,
and might probably be worked as iron ore, is very hard and heavy, and of a 
firm, compact texture, and composed of a small roundish crystalline grit, 
cemented together by a brown, terrene, ferruginous matter; will not cut 
without difficulty, nor easily strike fire with steel.&nbsp; Being often 
found in broad flat pieces, it makes good pavement for paths about houses, 
never becoming <!-- page 20--><a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
20</span>slippery in frost or rain, is excellent for dry walls, and is 
sometimes used in buildings.&nbsp; In many parts of that waste it lies 
scattered on the surface of the ground, but is dug on Weaver&rsquo;s Down, 
a vast hill on the eastern verge of that forest, where the pits are shallow
and the stratum thin.&nbsp; This stone is imperishable.</p>
<p>From a notion of rendering their work the more elegant, and giving it a 
finish, masons chip this stone into small fragments about the size of the 
head of a large nail, and then stick the pieces into the wet mortar along 
the joints of their freestone walls.&nbsp; This embellishment carries an 
odd appearance, and has occasioned strangers sometimes to ask us 
pleasantly, &ldquo;whether we fastened our walls together with tenpenny 
nails.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>LETTER V.</h3>
<p>Among the singularities of this place the two rocky, hollow lanes, the 
one to Alton, and the other to the forest, deserve our attention.&nbsp; 
These roads, running through the malm lands, are, by the traffic of ages, 
and the fretting of water, worn down through the first stratum of our 
freestone, and partly through the second; so that they look more like 
water-courses <!-- page 21--><a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
21</span>than roads; and are bedded with naked rag for furlongs 
together.&nbsp; In many places they are reduced sixteen or eighteen feet 
beneath the level of the fields; and after floods, and in frosts, exhibit 
very grotesque and wild appearances, from the tangled roots that are 
twisted among the strata, and from the torrents rushing down their broken 
sides; and especially when those cascades are frozen into icicles, hanging 
in all the fanciful shapes of frost-work.&nbsp; These rugged, gloomy scenes
affright the ladies when they peep down into them from the paths above, and
make timid horsemen shudder while they ride along them; but delight the 
naturalist with their various botany, and particularly with their curious 
filices with which they abound.</p>
<p>The manor of Selborne, was it strictly looked after, with all its kindly
aspects, and all its sloping coverts, would swarm with game; even now 
hares, partridges, and pheasants abound; and in old days woodcocks were as 
plentiful.&nbsp; There are few quails, because they more affect open fields
than enclosures; after harvest some few landrails are seen.</p>
<p>The parish of Selborne, by taking in so much of the forest, is a vast 
district.&nbsp; Those who tread the bounds are employed part of three days 
in the business, and are of opinion that the outline, in all its curves and
indentings, does not comprise less than thirty miles.</p>
<p><!-- page 22--><a name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
22</span>The village stands in a sheltered spot, secured by the Hanger from
the strong westerly winds.&nbsp; The air is soft, but rather moist from the
effluvia of so many trees; yet perfectly healthy and free from agues.</p>
<p>The quantity of rain that falls on it is very considerable, as may be 
supposed in so woody and mountainous a district.&nbsp; As my experience of 
measuring the water is but of short date, I am not qualified to give the 
mean quantity.&nbsp; I only know that</p>

<p>The village of Selborne, and large hamlet of Oakhanger, with the single 
farms, and many scattered houses along the verge of the forest, contain 
upwards of six hundred and seventy inhabitants.</p>
<p>We abound with poor, many of whom are sober and industrious, and live 
comfortably in good stone or brick cottages, which are glazed, and have 
chambers above stairs; mud buildings we have none.&nbsp; Besides <!-- page 
23--><a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>the employment 
from husbandry, the men work in hop-gardens, of which we have many, and 
fell and bark timber.&nbsp; In the spring and summer the women weed the 
corn, and enjoy a second harvest in September by hop-picking.&nbsp; 
Formerly, in the dead months they availed themselves greatly by spinning 
wool, for making of barragons, a genteel corded stuff, much in vogue at 
that time for summer wear, and chiefly manufactured at Alton, a 
neighbouring town, by some of the people called Quakers; but from 
circumstances this trade is at an end.&nbsp; The inhabitants enjoy a good 
share of health and longevity; and the parish swarms with children.</p>
<h3>LETTER VI.</h3>
<p>Should I omit to describe with some exactness the forest of Wolmer, of 
which three-fifths perhaps lie in this parish, my account of Selborne would
be very imperfect, as it is a district abounding with many curious 
productions, both animal and vegetable, and has often afforded me much 
entertainment both as a sportsman and as a naturalist.</p>
<p>The royal forest of Wolmer is a tract of land of about seven miles in 
length, by two and a half in <!-- page 24--><a name="page24"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 24</span>breadth, running nearly from north to south, 
and is abutted on, to begin to the south, and so to proceed eastward, by 
the parishes of Greatham, Lysse, Rogate, and Trotton, in the county of 
Sussex; by Bramshot, Hadleigh, and Kingsley.&nbsp; This royalty consists 
entirely of sand covered with heath and fern, but is somewhat diversified 
with hills and dales, without having one standing tree in the whole 
extent.&nbsp; In the bottoms, where the waters stagnate, are many bogs, 
which formerly abounded with subterraneous trees, though Dr. Plot says 
positively, that &ldquo;there never were any fallen trees hidden in the 
mosses of the southern counties.&rdquo;&nbsp; But he was mistaken: for I 
myself have seen cottages on the verge of this wild district, whose timbers
consisted of a black hard wood, looking like oak, which the owners assured 
me they procured from the bogs by probing the soil with spits, or some such
instruments: but the peat is so much cut out, and the moors have been so 
well examined, that none has been found of late.&nbsp; Besides the oak, I 
have also been shown pieces of fossil wood of a paler colour, and softer 
nature, which the inhabitants called fir: but, upon a nice examination, and
trial by fire, I could discover nothing resinous in them, and therefore 
rather suppose that they were parts of a willow or alder, or some such 
aquatic tree.</p>
<p>This lonely domain is a very agreeable haunt for <!-- page 25--><a 
name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 25</span>many sorts of wild 
fowls, which not only frequent it in the winter, but breed there in the 
summer: such as lapwings, snipes, wild ducks, and, as I have discovered 
within these few years, teals.&nbsp; Partridges in vast plenty are bred in 
good seasons on the verge of this forest, into which they love to make 
excursions; and in particular, in the dry summers of 1740 and 1741, and 
some years after, they swarmed to such a degree that parties of 
unreasonable sportsmen killed twenty and sometimes thirty brace in a 
day.</p>
<p>But there was a nobler species of game in this forest, now extinct, 
which I have heard old people say abounded much before shooting flying 
became so common, and that was the heath-cock, black-game, or grouse.&nbsp;
When I was a little boy I recollect one coming now and then to my 
father&rsquo;s table.&nbsp; The last pack remembered was killed about 
thirty-five years ago; and within these ten years one solitary greyhen was 
sprung by some beagles in beating for a hare.&nbsp; The sportsmen cried 
out, &ldquo;A hen pheasant!&rdquo; but a gentleman present, who had often 
seen grouse in the north of England, assured me that it was a greyhen.</p>
<p>Nor does the loss of our black game prove the only gap in the Fauna 
Selborniensis; for another beautiful link in the chain of beings is 
wanting.&nbsp; I mean the red deer, which toward the beginning of this 
century amounted to about five hundred head, and made a <!-- page 26--><a 
name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 26</span>stately 
appearance.&nbsp; There is an old keeper, now alive, named Adams, whose 
great grandfather (mentioned in a perambulation taken in 1635), 
grandfather, father, and self, enjoyed the head keepership of Wolmer Forest
in succession for more than a hundred years.&nbsp; This person assures me, 
that his father has often told him that Queen Anne, as she was journeying 
on the Portsmouth road, did not think the forest of Wolmer beneath her 
royal regard.&nbsp; For she came out of the great road at Lippock, which is
just by, and, reposing herself on a bank smoothed for that purpose, lying 
about half a mile to the east of Wolmer Pond, and still called 
Queen&rsquo;s Bank, saw with great complacency and satisfaction the whole 
herd of red deer brought by the keepers along the vale before her, 
consisting then of about five hundred head.&nbsp; A sight this, worthy the 
attention of the greatest sovereign!&nbsp; But he farther adds that, by 
means of the Waltham blacks, or, to use his own expression, as soon as they
began blacking, they were reduced to about fifty head, and so continued 
decreasing till the time of the late Duke of Cumberland.&nbsp; It is now 
more than thirty years ago that His Highness sent down a huntsman, and six 
yeoman-prickers, in scarlet jackets laced with gold, attended by the 
staghounds, ordering them to take every deer in this forest alive, and to 
convey them in carts to Windsor.&nbsp; In the course of the summer they 
<!-- page 27--><a name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
27</span>caught every stag, some of which showed extraordinary diversion; 
but in the following winter, when the hinds were also carried off, such 
fine chases were exhibited as served the country people for matter of talk 
and wonder for years afterwards.&nbsp; I saw myself one of the 
yeoman-prickers single out a stag from the herd, and must confess that it 
was the most curious feat of activity I ever beheld, superior to anything 
in Mr. Astley&rsquo;s riding-school.&nbsp; The exertions made by the horse 
and deer much exceeded all my expectations, though the former greatly 
excelled the latter in speed.&nbsp; When the devoted deer was separated 
from his companions, they gave him, by their watches, law, as they called 
it, for twenty minutes; when, sounding their horns, the stop-dogs were 
permitted to pursue, and a most gallant scene ensued.</p>
<h3>LETTER VII.</h3>
<p>Though large herds of deer do much harm to the neighbourhood, yet the 
injury to the morals of the people is of more moment than the loss of their
crops.&nbsp; The temptation is irresistible; for most men are sportsmen by 
constitution: and there is such an inherent spirit for hunting in human 
nature, as scarce <!-- page 28--><a name="page28"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 28</span>any inhibitions can restrain.&nbsp; Hence, 
towards the beginning of this century all this country was wild about 
deer-stealing.&nbsp; Unless he was a hunter, as they affected to call 
themselves, no young person was allowed to be possessed of manhood or 
gallantry.&nbsp; The Waltham blacks at length committed such enormities, 
that Government was forced to interfere with that severe and sanguinary act
called the &ldquo;Black Act,&rdquo; which now comprehends more felonies 
than any law that ever was framed before.&nbsp; And, therefore, a late 
Bishop of Winchester, when urged to re-stock Waltham Chase, refused, from a
motive worthy of a prelate, replying &ldquo;that it had done mischief 
enough already.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Our old race of deer-stealers is hardly extinct yet: it was but a little
while ago that, over their ale, they used to recount the exploits of their 
youth; such as watching the pregnant hind to her lair, and, when the calf 
was dropped, paring its feet with a penknife to the quick to prevent its 
escape, till it was large and fat enough to be killed; the shooting at one 
of their neighbours with a bullet in a turnip-field by moonshine, mistaking
him for a deer; and the losing a dog in the following extraordinary manner:
Some fellows, suspecting that a calf new-fallen was deposited in a certain 
spot of thick fern, went, with a lurcher, to surprise it; when the 
parent-hind rushed out of the brake, and, taking a vast spring with all her
feet close <!-- page 29--><a name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
29</span>together, pitched upon the neck of the dog, and broke it short in 
two.</p>
<p>Another temptation to idleness and sporting was a number of rabbits, 
which possessed all the hillocks and dry places: but these being 
inconvenient to the huntsmen, on account of their burrows, when they came 
to take away the deer, they permitted the country people to destroy them 
all.</p>
<p>Such forests and wastes, when their allurements to irregularities are 
removed, are of considerable service to neighbourhoods that verge upon 
them, by furnishing them with peat and turf for their firing; with fuel for
the burning their lime; and with ashes for their grasses; and by 
maintaining their geese and their stock of young cattle at little or no 
expense.</p>
<p>The manor farm of the parish of Greatham has an admitted claim, I see 
(by an old record taken from the Tower of London) of turning all live stock
on the forest, at proper seasons, &ldquo;bidentibus exceptis.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
The reason, I presume, why sheep are excluded, is because, being such close
grazers, they would pick out all the finest grasses, and hinder the deer 
from thriving.</p>
<p>Though (by statute 4 and 5 W. and Mary, c. 23) &ldquo;to burn on any 
waste, between Candlemas and Midsummer, any grig, ling, heath and furze, 
goss or fern, is punishable with whipping and confinement in the house of 
correction;&rdquo; yet, in this forest, about <!-- page 30--><a 
name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 30</span>March or April, 
according to the dryness of the season, such vast heath-fires are lighted 
up, that they often get to a masterless head, and, catching the hedges, 
have sometimes been communicated to the underwoods, woods, and coppices, 
where great damage has ensued.&nbsp; The plea for these burnings is that, 
when the old coat of heath, etc., is consumed, young will sprout up, and 
afford much tender browze for cattle; but, where there is large old furze, 
the fire, following the roots, consumes the very ground; so that for 
hundreds of acres nothing is to be seen but smother and desolation, the 
whole circuit round looking like the cinders of a volcano; and, the soil 
being quite exhausted, no traces of vegetation are to be found for 
years.&nbsp; These conflagrations, as they take place usually with a 
north-east or east wind, much annoy this village with their smoke, and 
often alarm the country; and, once in particular, I remember that a 
gentleman, who lives beyond Andover, coming to my house, when he got on the
downs between that town and Winchester, at twenty-five miles&rsquo; 
distance, was surprised much with smoke and a hot smell of fire, and 
concluded that Alresford was in flames; but, when he came to that town, he 
then had apprehensions for the next village, and so on to the end of his 
journey.</p>
<p>On two of the most conspicuous eminences of this forest stand two 
arbours or bowers, made of the <!-- page 31--><a name="page31"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 31</span>boughs of oak; the one called Waldon Lodge, the
other Brimstone Lodge: these the keepers renew annually on the feast of St.
Barnabas, taking the old materials for a perquisite.&nbsp; The farm called 
Blackmoor, in this parish, is obliged to find the posts and brush-wood for 
the former; while the farms at Greatham, in rotation, furnish for the 
latter, and are all enjoined to cut and deliver the materials at the 
spot.&nbsp; This custom I mention, because I look upon it to be of very 
remote antiquity.</p>
<h3>LETTER VIII.</h3>
<p>On the verge of the forest, as it is now circumscribed, are three 
considerable lakes, two in Oakhanger, of which I have nothing particular to
say; and one called Bin&rsquo;s, or Bean&rsquo;s Pond, which is worthy the 
attention of a naturalist or a sportsman.&nbsp; For, being crowded at the 
upper end with willows, and with the carex cespitosa, it affords such a 
safe and pleasing shelter to wild ducks, teals, snipes, etc., that they 
breed there.&nbsp; In the winter this covert is also frequented by foxes, 
and sometimes by pheasants; and the bogs produce many curious plants.&nbsp;
(For which consult Letter XLI. to Mr. Barrington.)</p>
<p><!-- page 32--><a name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 32</span>By
a perambulation of Wolmer Forest and the Holt, made in 1635, and the 
eleventh year of Charles I. (which now lies before me), it appears that the
limits of the former are much circumscribed.&nbsp; For, to say nothing of 
the farther side, with which I am not so well acquainted, the bounds on 
this side, in old times, came into Binswood, and extended to the ditch of 
Ward le Ham Park, in which stands the curious mount called King 
John&rsquo;s Hill, and Lodge Hill; and to the verge of Hartley Mauduit, 
called Mauduit Hatch; comprehending also Short Heath, Oakhanger, and 
Oakwoods&mdash;a large district, now private property, though once 
belonging to the royal domain.</p>
<p>It is remarkable that the term purlieu is never once mentioned in this 
long roll of parchment.&nbsp; It contains, besides the perambulation, a 
rough estimate of the value of the timbers, which were considerable, 
growing at that time in the district of the Holt, and enumerates the 
officers, superior and inferior, of those joint forests, for the time 
being, and their ostensible fees and perquisites.&nbsp; In those days, as 
at present, there were hardly any trees in Wolmer Forest.</p>
<p>Within the present limits of the forest are three considerable lakes, 
Hogmer, Cranmer, and Wolmer, all of which are stocked with carp, tench, 
eels, and perch: but the fish do not thrive well, because the water is 
hungry, and the bottoms are a naked sand.</p>
<p><!-- page 33--><a name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 33</span>A 
circumstance respecting these ponds, though by no means peculiar to them, I
cannot pass over in silence; and that is, that instinct by which in summer 
all the kine, whether oxen, cows, calves, or heifers, retire constantly to 
the water during the hotter hours; where, being more exempt from flies, and
inhaling the coolness of that element, some belly deep, and some only to 
mid-leg, they ruminate and solace themselves from about ten in the morning 
till four in the afternoon, and then return to their feeding.&nbsp; During 
this great proportion of the day they drop much dung, in which insects 
nestle, and so supply food for the fish, which would be poorly subsisted 
but from this contingency.&nbsp; Thus Nature, who is a great economist, 
converts the recreation of one animal to the support of another!&nbsp; 
Thomson, who was a nice observer of natural occurrences, did not let this 
pleasing circumstance escape him.&nbsp; He says, in his 
&ldquo;Summer,&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;A various group the herds and flocks compose;<br />
. . . on the grassy bank<br />
Some ruminating lie; while others stand<br />
Half in the flood, and, often bending, sip<br />
The circling surface.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wolmer Pond, so called, I suppose, for eminence sake, is a vast lake for
this part of the world, containing, in its whole circumference, 2,646 
yards, or very near a mile and a half.&nbsp; The length of the north-west 
<!-- page 34--><a name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 34</span>and 
opposite side is about 704 yards, and the breadth of the south-west end 
about 456 yards.&nbsp; This measurement, which I caused to be made with 
good exactness, gives an area of about sixty-six acres, exclusive of a 
large irregular arm at the north-east corner, which we did not take into 
the reckoning.</p>
<p>On the face of this expanse of waters, and perfectly secure from 
fowlers, lie all day long, in the winter season, vast flocks of ducks, 
teals, and widgeons, of various denominations, where they preen and solace,
and rest themselves, till towards sunset, when they issue forth in little 
parties (for in their natural state they are all birds of the night) to 
feed in the brooks and meadows, returning again with the dawn of the 
morning.&nbsp; Had this lake an arm or two more, and were it planted round 
with thick covert (for now it is perfectly naked), it might make a valuable
decoy.</p>
<p>Yet neither its extent, nor the clearness of its water, nor the resort 
of various and curious fowls, nor its picturesque groups of cattle, can 
render this mere so remarkable as the great quantity of coins that were 
found in its bed about forty years ago.&nbsp; But, as such discoveries more
properly belong to the antiquities of this place, I shall suppress all 
particulars for the present, till I enter professedly on my series of 
letters respecting the more remote history of this village and 
district.</p>
<h3><!-- page 35--><a name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
35</span>LETTER IX.</h3>
<p>By way of supplement, I shall trouble you once more on this subject, to 
inform you that Wolmer, with her sister forest Ayles Holt, <i>alias</i> 
Alice Holt, as it is called in old records, is held by grant from the crown
for a term of years.</p>
<p>The grantees that the author remembers are Brigadier-General Emanuel 
Scroope Howe, and his lady, Ruperta, who was a natural daughter of Prince 
Rupert by Margaret Hughes; a Mr. Mordaunt, of the Peterborough family, who 
married a dowager Lady Pembroke; Henry Bilson Legge and lady; and now Lord 
Stawell, their son.</p>
<p>The lady of General Howe lived to an advanced age, long surviving her 
husband, and, at her death, left behind her many curious pieces of 
mechanism of her father&rsquo;s constructing, who was a distinguished 
mechanic and artist, as well as warrior; and among the rest, a very 
complicated clock, lately in possession of Mr. Elmer, the celebrated game 
painter, at Farnham, in the county of Surrey.</p>
<p>Though these two forests are only parted by a narrow range of 
enclosures, yet no two soils can be more different; for the Holt consists 
of a strong loam, of a miry nature, carrying a good turf, and abounding 
<!-- page 36--><a name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 36</span>with 
oaks that grow to be large timber; while Wolmer is nothing but a hungry, 
sandy, barren waste.&nbsp; The former being all in the parish of Binsted, 
is about two miles in extent from north to south, and near as much from 
east to west, and contains within it many woodlands and lawns, and the 
great lodge where the grantees reside, and a smaller lodge called Goose 
Green; and is abutted on by the parishes of Kingsley, Frinsham, Farnham, 
and Bentley; all of which have right of common.</p>
<p>One thing is remarkable, that though the Holt has been of old well 
stocked with fallow-deer, unrestrained by any pales or fences more than a 
common hedge, yet they were never seen within the limits of Wolmer; nor 
were the red deer of Wolmer ever known to haunt the thickets or glades of 
the Holt.</p>
<p>At present the deer of the Holt are much thinned and reduced by the 
night hunters, who perpetually harass them in spite of the efforts of 
numerous keepers, and the severe penalties that have been put in force 
against them as often as they have been detected, and rendered liable to 
the lash of the law.&nbsp; Neither fines nor imprisonments can deter them, 
so impossible is it to extinguish the spirit of sporting which seems to be 
inherent in human nature.</p>
<p>General Howe turned out some German wild boars and sows in his forests, 
to the great terror of the <!-- page 37--><a name="page37"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 37</span>neighbourhood, and, at one time, a wild bull or
buffalo; but the country rose upon them and destroyed them.</p>
<p>A very large fall of timber, consisting of about one thousand oaks, has 
been cut this spring (viz., 1784) in the Holt forest: one fifth of which, 
it is said, belongs to the grantee, Lord Stawell.&nbsp; He lays claim also 
to the lop and top; but the poor of the parishes of Binsted and Frinsham, 
Bentley and Kingsley, assert that it belongs to them, and assembling in a 
riotous manner, have actually taken it all away.&nbsp; One man, who keeps a
team, has carried home for his share forty stacks of wood.&nbsp; Forty-five
of these people his lordship has served with actions.&nbsp; These trees, 
which were very sound and in high perfection, were winter-cut, viz., in 
February and March, before the bark would run.&nbsp; In old times the Holt 
was estimated to be eighteen miles, computed measure from water-carriage, 
viz., from the town of Chertsey, on the Thames; but now it is not half that
distance, since the Wey is made navigable up to the town of Godalming, in 
the county of Surrey.</p>
<h3><!-- page 38--><a name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
38</span>LETTER X.</h3>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>August 4th</i>, 1767.</p>
<p>It has been my misfortune never to have had any neighbours whose studies
have led them towards the pursuit of natural knowledge; so that, for want 
of a companion to quicken my industry and sharpen my attention, I have made
but slender progress in a kind of information to which I have been attached
from my childhood.</p>
<p>As to swallows (<i>hirundines rustic&aelig;</i>) being found in a torpid
state during the winter in the Isle of Wight or any part of this country, I
never heard any such account worth attending to.&nbsp; But a clergyman, of 
an inquisitive turn, assures me, that when he was a great boy, some 
workmen, in pulling down the battlements of a church tower early in the 
spring, found two or three swifts (<i>hirundines apodes</i>) among the 
rubbish, which were at first appearance dead, but on being carried towards 
the fire revived.&nbsp; He told me, that out of his great care to preserve 
them, he put them in a paper bag, and hung them by the kitchen fire, where 
they were suffocated.</p>
<p>Another intelligent person has informed me, that while he was a 
schoolboy at Brighthelmstone, in Sussex, a great fragment of the chalk 
cliff fell down one stormy <!-- page 39--><a name="page39"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 39</span>winter on the beach, and that many people found
swallows among the rubbish; but on my questioning him whether he saw any of
those birds himself, to my no small disappointment, he answered me in the 
negative; but that others assured him they did.</p>
<p>Young broods of swallows began to appear this year on July 11th, and 
young martins (<i>hirundines urbic&aelig;</i>) were then fledged in their 
nests.&nbsp; Both species will breed again once.&nbsp; For I see by my 
fauna of last year, that young broods came forth so late as September 
18th.&nbsp; Are not these late hatchings more in favour of hiding than 
migration?&nbsp; Nay, some young martins remained in their nests last year 
so late as September 29th; and yet they totally disappeared with us by the 
5th October.</p>
<p>How strange it is that the swift, which seems to live exactly the same 
life with the swallow and house-martin, should leave us before the middle 
of August invariably! while the latter stay often till the middle of 
October; and once I saw numbers of house-martins on the 7th November.&nbsp;
The martins and red-wing fieldfares were flying in sight together, an 
uncommon assemblage of summer and winter birds!</p>
<p>A little yellow bird (it is either a species of the <i>alauda 
trivialis</i>, or rather perhaps of the <i>motacilla trochilus</i>) still 
continues to make a sibilous shivering noise in the tops of tall 
woods.&nbsp; The stoparola of Ray (for which <!-- page 40--><a 
name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 40</span>we have as yet no name 
in these parts) is called in your zoology the fly-catcher.&nbsp; There is 
one circumstance characteristic of this bird which seems to have escaped 
observation, and that is, it takes its stand on the top of some stake or 
post, from whence it springs forth on its prey, catching a fly in the air, 
and hardly ever touching the ground, but returning still to the same stand 
for many times together.</p>
<p>I perceive there are more than one species of the <i>motacilla 
trochilus</i>.&nbsp; Mr. Derham supposes, in &ldquo;Ray&rsquo;s Philos. 
Letters,&rdquo; that he has discovered three.&nbsp; In these there is again
an instance of some very common birds that have as yet no English name.</p>
<p>Mr. Stillingfleet makes a question whether the blackcap (<i>motacilla 
atricapilla</i>) be a bird of passage or not: I think there is no doubt of 
it: for, in April, in the first fine weather, they come trooping, all at 
once, into these parts, but are never seen in the winter.&nbsp; They are 
delicate songsters.</p>
<p>Numbers of snipes breed every summer in some moory ground on the verge 
of this parish.&nbsp; It is very amusing to see the cock bird on wing at 
that time, and to hear his piping and humming notes.</p>
<p>I have had no opportunity yet of procuring any of those mice which I 
mentioned to you in town.&nbsp; The person that brought me the last says 
they are plenty in harvest, at which time I will take care to get more; 
<!-- page 41--><a name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 41</span>and 
will endeavour to put the matter out of doubt whether it be a nondescript 
species or not.</p>
<p>I suspect much there may be two species of water-rats.&nbsp; Ray says, 
and Linn&aelig;us after him, that the water-rat is web-footed behind.&nbsp;
Now I have discovered a rat on the banks of our little stream that is not 
web-footed, and yet is an excellent swimmer and diver: it answers exactly 
to the <i>mus amphibius</i> of Linn&aelig;us (see <i>Syst. Nat</i>.), which
he says &ldquo;<i>natat in fossis et urinatur</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; I should be
glad to procure one &ldquo;<i>plantis palmatis</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
Linn&aelig;us seems to be in a puzzle about his <i>mus amphibius</i>, and 
to doubt whether it differs from his <i>mus terrestris</i>; which if it be,
as he allows, the &ldquo;<i>mus agrestis capite grandi 
brachyuros</i>,&rdquo; of Ray, is widely different from the water-rat, both
in size, make, and manner of life.</p>
<p>As to the <i>falco</i>, which I mentioned in town, I shall take the 
liberty to send it down to you into Wales; presuming on your candour that 
you will excuse me if it should appear as familiar to you as it is strange 
to me.&nbsp; Though mutilated &ldquo;<i>qualem dices . . . ante hac fuisse 
tales cum sint reliqui&aelig;</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It haunted a marshy piece of ground in quest of wild-ducks and snipes; 
but, when it was shot, had just knocked down a rook, which it was tearing 
in pieces.&nbsp; I cannot make it answer to any of our English hawks; 
neither could I find any like it at the curious exhibition of stuffed birds
in Spring Gardens.&nbsp; I found it nailed <!-- page 42--><a 
name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 42</span>up at the end of a 
barn, which is the countryman&rsquo;s museum.</p>
<p>The parish I live in is a very abrupt, uneven country, full of hills and
woods, and therefore full of birds.</p>
<h3>LETTER XI.</h3>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">Selborne</span>, 
<i>September 9th</i>, 1767.</p>
<p>It will not be without impatience that I shall wait for your thoughts 
with regard to the <i>falco</i>; as to its weight, breadth, etc., I wish I 
had set them down at the time; but, to the best of my remembrance, it 
weighed two pounds and eight ounces, and measured, from wing to wing, 
thirty-eight inches.&nbsp; Its cere and feet were yellow, and the circle of
its eyelids a bright yellow.&nbsp; As it had been killed some days, and the
eyes were sunk, I could make no good observation on the colour of the 
pupils and the irides.</p>
<p>The most unusual birds I ever observed in these parts were a pair of 
hoopoes (<i>upupa</i>), which came several years ago in the summer, and 
frequented an ornamented piece of ground, which joins to my garden, for 
some weeks.&nbsp; They used to march about in a stately manner, feeding in 
the walks, many times in the day; and seemed disposed to breed in my 
outlet; <!-- page 43--><a name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
43</span>but were frighted and persecuted by idle boys, who would never let
them be at rest.</p>
<p>Three grossbeaks (<i>loxia coccothraustes</i>) appeared some years ago 
in my fields, in the winter; one of which I shot.&nbsp; Since that, now and
then, one is occasionally seen in the same dead season.</p>
<p>A crossbill (<i>loxia curvirostra</i>) was killed last year in this 
neighbourhood.</p>
<p>Our streams, which are small, and rise only at the end of the village, 
yield nothing but the bull&rsquo;s head or miller&rsquo;s thumb (<i>gobius 
fluviatilis capitatus</i>), the trout (<i>trutta fluviatilis</i>), the eel 
(<i>anguilla</i>), the lampern (<i>lamp&oelig;tra parva et 
fluviatilis</i>), and the stickleback (<i>pisciculus aculeatus</i>).</p>
<p>We are twenty miles from the sea, and almost as many from a great river,
and therefore see but little of sea birds.&nbsp; As to wild fowls, we have 
a few teems of ducks bred in the moors where the snipes breed; and 
multitudes of widgeons and teals in hard weather frequent our lakes in the 
forest.</p>
<p>Having some acquaintance with the tame brown owl, I find that it casts 
up the fur of mice, and the feathers of birds in pellets, after the manner 
of hawks: when full, like a dog, it hides what it cannot eat.</p>
<p>The young of the barn-owl are not easily raised, as they want a constant
supply of fresh mice; whereas the young of the brown owl will eat 
indiscriminately <!-- page 44--><a name="page44"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 44</span>all that is brought: snails, rats, kittens, 
puppies, magpies, and any kind of carrion or offal.</p>
<p>The house-martins have eggs still, and squab young.&nbsp; The last swift
I observed was about the 21st August; it was a straggler.</p>
<p>Red-starts, fly-catchers, white-throats, and <i>reguli non cristati</i>,
still appear; but I have seen no black-caps lately.</p>
<p>I forgot to mention that I once saw, in Christ Church College quadrangle
in Oxford, on a very sunny warm morning, a house-martin flying about, and 
settling on the parapet, so late as the 20th November.</p>
<p>At present I know only two species of bats, the common <i>vespertilio 
murinus</i> and the <i>vespertilio auribus</i>.</p>
<p>I was much entertained last summer with a tame bat, which would take 
flies out of a person&rsquo;s hand.&nbsp; If you gave it anything to eat, 
it brought its wings round before the mouth, hovering and hiding its head 
in the manner of birds of prey when they feed.&nbsp; The adroitness it 
showed in shearing off the wings of the flies, which were always rejected, 
was worthy of observation, and pleased me much.&nbsp; Insects seemed to be 
most acceptable, though it did not refuse raw flesh when offered; so that 
the notion, that bats go down chimneys and gnaw men&rsquo;s bacon, seems no
improbable story.&nbsp; While I amused myself with this wonderful <!-- page
45--><a name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 45</span>quadruped, I 
saw it several times confute the vulgar opinion, that bats when down upon a
flat surface cannot get on the wing again, by rising with great ease from 
the floor.&nbsp; It ran, I observed, with more despatch than I was aware 
of, but in a most ridiculous and grotesque manner.</p>
<p>Bats drink on the wing, like swallows, by sipping the surface as they 
play over pools and streams.&nbsp; They love to frequent waters, not only 
for the sake of drinking, but on account of insects, which are found over 
them in the greatest plenty.&nbsp; As I was going some years ago, pretty 
late, in a boat from Richmond to Sunbury, on a warm summer&rsquo;s evening,
I think I saw myriads of bats between the two places.&nbsp; The air swarmed
with them all along the Thames, so that hundreds were in sight at a 
time.</p>

<h3>LETTER XII.</h3>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>November 4th</i>, 1767.</p>
<p>Sir,&mdash;It gave me no small satisfaction to hear that the 
<i>falco</i> turned out an uncommon one.&nbsp; I must confess I should have
been better pleased to have heard that I had sent you a bird that you had 
never seen before; but that, I find, would be a difficult task.</p>
<p><!-- page 46--><a name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 46</span>I 
have procured some of the mice mentioned in my former letters, a young one 
and a female with young, both of which I have preserved in brandy.&nbsp; 
From the colour, shape, size, and manner of nesting, I make no doubt but 
that the species is nondescript.&nbsp; They are much smaller, and more 
slender, than the <i>mus domesticus medius</i> of Ray, and have more of the
squirrel or dormouse colour; their belly is white, a straight line along 
their sides divides the shades of their back and belly.&nbsp; They never 
enter into houses; are carried into ricks and barns with the sheaves, 
abound in harvest; and build their nests amidst the straws of the corn 
above the ground, and sometimes in thistles.&nbsp; They breed as many as 
eight at a litter, in a little round nest composed of the blades of grass 
or wheat.</p>
<p>One of these nests I procured this autumn, most artificially platted, 
and composed of the blades of wheat, perfectly round, and about the size of
a cricket ball, with the aperture so ingeniously closed, that there was no 
discovering to what part it belonged.&nbsp; It was so compact and well 
filled, that it would roll across the table without being discomposed, 
though it contained eight little mice that were naked and blind.&nbsp; As 
this nest was perfectly full, how could the dam come at her litter 
respectively, so as to administer a teat to each?&nbsp; Perhaps she opens 
different places for that purpose, adjusting them again when the business 
<!-- page 47--><a name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 47</span>is 
over; but she could not possibly be contained herself in the ball with her 
young, which moreover would be daily increasing in bulk.&nbsp; This 
wonderful procreant cradle, an elegant instance of the efforts of instinct,
was found in a wheat-field suspended in the head of a thistle.</p>
<p>A gentleman, curious in birds, wrote me word that his servant had shot 
one last January, in that severe weather, which he believed would puzzle 
me.&nbsp; I called to see it this summer, not knowing what to expect, but 
the moment I took it in hand I pronounced it the male <i>garrulus 
bohemicus</i> or German silk-tail, from the five peculiar crimson tags or 
points which it carries at the ends of five of the short remiges.&nbsp; It 
cannot, I suppose, with any propriety, be called an English bird, and yet I
see, by Ray&rsquo;s &ldquo;Philosophical Letters,&rdquo; that great flocks 
of them, feeding on haws, appeared in this kingdom in the winter of 
1685.</p>
<p>The mention of haws puts me in mind that there is a total failure of 
that wild fruit, so conducive to the support of many of the winged 
nation.&nbsp; For the same severe weather, late in the spring, which cut 
off all the produce of the more tender and curious trees, destroyed also 
that of the more hardy and common.</p>
<p>Some birds, haunting with the missel-thrushes, and feeding on the 
berries of the yew tree, which answered to the description of the <i>merula
torquata</i>, or <!-- page 48--><a name="page48"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 48</span>ring-ouzel, were lately seen in this 
neighbourhood.&nbsp; I employed some people to procure me a specimen, but 
without success.&nbsp; (See Letter VIII.)</p>
<p><i>Query</i>.&mdash;Might not canary birds be naturalised to this 
climate, provided their eggs were put, in the spring, into the nests of 
some of their congeners, as goldfinches, greenfinches, etc?&nbsp; Before 
winter perhaps they might be hardened, and able to shift for 
themselves.</p>
<p>About ten years ago I used to spend some weeks yearly at Sunbury, which 
is one of those pleasant villages lying on the Thames, near Hampton 
Court.&nbsp; In the autumn, I could not help being much amused with those 
myriads of the swallow kind which assemble in those parts.&nbsp; But what 
struck me most was, that, from the time they began to congregate, forsaking
the chimneys and houses, they roosted every night in the osier-beds of the 
aits of that river.&nbsp; Now, this resorting towards that element, at that
season of the year, seems to give some countenance to the northern opinion 
(strange as it is) of their retiring under water.&nbsp; A Swedish 
naturalist is so much persuaded of that fact, that he talks, in his 
calendar of Flora, as familiarly of the swallows going under water in the 
beginning of September, as he would of his poultry going to roost a little 
before sunset.</p>
<p>An observing gentleman in London writes me word that he saw a 
house-martin, on the twenty-third of last <!-- page 49--><a 
name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 49</span>October, flying in and 
out of its nest in the Borough.&nbsp; And I myself, on the twenty-ninth of 
last October (as I was travelling through Oxford), saw four or five 
swallows hovering round and settling on the roof of the county 
hospital.</p>
<p>Now is it likely that these poor little birds (which perhaps had not 
been hatched but a few weeks) should, at that late season of the year, and 
from so midland a county, attempt a voyage to Goree or Senegal, almost as 
far as the equator?</p>
<p>I acquiesce entirely in your opinion&mdash;that, though most of the 
swallow kind may migrate, yet that some do stay behind and hide with us 
during the winter.</p>
<p>As to the short-winged, soft-billed birds, which come trooping in such 
numbers in the spring, I am at a loss even what to suspect about 
them.&nbsp; I watched them narrowly this year, and saw them abound till 
about Michaelmas, when they appeared no longer.&nbsp; Subsist they cannot 
openly among us, and yet elude the eyes of the inquisitive; and, as to 
their hiding, no man pretends to have found any of them in a torpid state 
in the winter.&nbsp; But with regard to their migration, what difficulties 
attend that supposition! that such feeble bad fliers (who the summer long 
never flit but from hedge to hedge) should be able to traverse vast seas 
and continents in order to enjoy milder seasons amidst the regions of 
Africa!</p>
<h3><!-- page 50--><a name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
50</span>LETTER XIII.</h3>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">Selborne</span>, <i>Jan. 
22nd</i>, 1768.</p>
<p>Sir,&mdash;As in one of your former letters you expressed the more 
satisfaction from my correspondence on account of my living in the most 
southerly county, so now I may return the compliment, and expect to have my
curiosity gratified by your living much more to the North.</p>
<p>For many years past I have observed that towards Christmas vast flocks 
of chaffinches have appeared in the fields; many more, I used to think, 
than could be hatched in any one neighbourhood.&nbsp; But, when I came to 
observe them more narrowly, I was amazed to find that they seemed to me to 
be almost all hens.&nbsp; I communicated my suspicions to some intelligent 
neighbours, who, after taking pains about the matter, declared that they 
also thought them mostly females&mdash;at least fifty to one.&nbsp; This 
extraordinary occurrence brought to my mind the remark of Linn&aelig;us, 
that &ldquo;before winter all their hen chaffinches migrate through Holland
into Italy.&rdquo;&nbsp; Now I want to know, from some curious person in 
the north, whether there are any large flocks of these finches with them in
the winter, and of which sex they mostly consist?&nbsp; For from such 
intelligence, one might be able to judge whether our <!-- page 51--><a 
name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 51</span>female flocks migrate 
from the other end of the island, or whether they come over to us from the 
continent.&nbsp; We have, in the winter, vast flocks of the common linnets;
more, I think, than can be bred in any one district.&nbsp; These, I 
observe, when the spring advances, assemble on some tree in the sunshine, 
and join all in a gentle sort of chirping, as if they were about to break 
up their winter quarters and betake themselves to their proper summer 
homes.&nbsp; It is well known, at least, that the swallows and the 
fieldfares do congregate with a gentle twittering before they make their 
respective departure.</p>
<p>You may depend on it that the bunting, <i>Emberiza miliaria</i>, does 
not leave this county in the winter.&nbsp; In January, 1767, I saw several 
dozen of them, in the midst of a severe frost, among the bushes on the 
downs near Andover: in our woodland-enclosed district it is a rare 
bird.</p>
<p>Wagtails, both white and yellow, are with us all the winter.&nbsp; 
Quails crowd to our southern coast, and are often killed in numbers by 
people that go on purpose.</p>
<p>Mr. Stillingfleet, in his Tracts, says that &ldquo;if the wheatear 
(<i>&oelig;nanthe</i>) does not quit England, it certainly shifts places; 
for about harvest they are not to be found, where there was before great 
plenty of them.&rdquo;&nbsp; This well accounts for the vast quantities 
that are caught about that time on the south downs near Lewes, <!-- page 
52--><a name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 52</span>where they are 
esteemed a delicacy.&nbsp; There have been shepherds, I have been credibly 
informed, that have made many pounds in a season by catching them in 
traps.&nbsp; And though such multitudes are taken, I never saw (and I am 
well acquainted with those parts) above two or three at a time, for they 
are never gregarious.&nbsp; They may perhaps migrate in general, and, for 
that purpose, draw towards the coast of Sussex in autumn: but that they do 
not all withdraw I am sure, because I see a few stragglers in many 
counties, at all times of the year, especially about warrens and stone 
quarries.</p>
<p>I have no acquaintance, at present, among the gentlemen of the navy; but
have written to a friend, who was a sea-chaplain in the late war, desiring 
him to look into his minutes, with respect to birds that settled on their 
rigging during their voyage up or down the Channel.&nbsp; What Hasselquist 
says on that subject is remarkable; there were little short-winged birds 
frequently coming on board his ship all the way from our channel quite up 
to the Levant, especially before squally weather.</p>
<p>What you suggest, with regard to Spain, is highly probable.&nbsp; The 
winters of Andalusia are so mild, that, in all likelihood, the soft-billed 
birds that leave us at that season may find insects sufficient to support 
them there.</p>
<p>Some young man, possessed of fortune, health, and <!-- page 53--><a 
name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 53</span>leisure, should make an
autumnal voyage into that kingdom, and should spend a year there, 
investigating the natural history of that vast country.&nbsp; Mr. Willughby
passed through that kingdom on such an errand; but he seems to have skirted
along in a superficial manner and an ill-humour, being much disgusted at 
the rude dissolute manners of the people.</p>
<p>I have no friend left now at Sunbury to apply to about the swallows 
roosting on the aits of the Thames: nor can I hear any more about those 
birds which I suspected were <i>Merul&oelig; torquat&oelig;</i>.</p>
<p>As to the small mice, I have farther to remark, that though they hang 
their nests for breeding up amidst the straws of the standing corn, above 
the ground, yet I find that, in the winter, they burrow deep in the earth, 
and make warm beds of grass: but their grand rendezvous seems to be in 
corn-ricks, into which they are carried at harvest.&nbsp; A neighbour 
housed an oat-rick lately, under the thatch of which were assembled nearly 
a hundred, most of which were taken, and some I saw.&nbsp; I measured them,
and found that, from nose to tail, they were just two inches and a quarter,
and their tails just two inches long.&nbsp; Two of them, in a scale, 
weighed down just one copper halfpenny, which is about the third of an 
ounce avoirdupois: so that I suppose they are the smallest quadrupeds in 
this island.&nbsp; A full-grown <i>Mus medius domesticus</i> weighs, I 
find, <!-- page 54--><a name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
54</span>one ounce lumping weight, which is more than six times as much as 
the mouse above; and measures from nose to rump four inches and a quarter, 
and the same in its tail.&nbsp; We have had a very severe frost and deep 
snow this month.&nbsp; My thermometer was one day fourteen degrees and a 
half below the freezing-point, within doors.&nbsp; The tender evergreens 
were injured pretty much.&nbsp; It was very providential that the air was 
still, and the ground well covered with snow, else vegetation in general 
must have suffered prodigiously.&nbsp; There is reason to believe that some
days were more severe than any since the year 1739-40.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">I am, etc., etc.</p>
<h3>LETTER XIV.</h3>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">Selborne</span>, <i>March 
12th</i>, 1768.</p>
<p>Dear Sir,&mdash;If some curious gentleman would procure the head of a 
fallow-deer, and have it dissected, he would find it furnished with two 
spiracula, or breathing places, besides the nostrils; probably analogous to
the <i>puncta lachrymalia</i> in the human head.&nbsp; When deer are 
thirsty they plunge their noses, like some horses, very deep under water, 
while in the act of drinking, and continue them in that situation for a 
<!-- page 55--><a name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
55</span>considerable time: but, to obviate any inconveniency, they can 
open two vents, one at the inner corner of each eye, having a communication
with the nose.&nbsp; Here seems to be an extraordinary provision of nature 
worthy our attention, and which has not, that I know of, been noticed by 
any naturalist.&nbsp; For it looks as if these creatures would not be 
suffocated, though both their mouths and nostrils were stopped.&nbsp; This 
curious formation of the head may be of singular service to beasts of 
chase, by affording them free respiration: and no doubt these additional 
nostrils are thrown open when they are hard run.&nbsp; Mr. Ray observed 
that at Malta the owners slit up the nostrils of such asses as were hard 
worked: for they, being naturally straight or small, did not admit air 
sufficient to serve them when they travelled, or laboured, in that hot 
climate.&nbsp; And we know that grooms, and gentlemen of the turf, think 
large nostrils necessary, and a perfection, in hunters and running 
horses.</p>
<p>Oppian, the Greek poet, by the following line, seems to have had some 
notion that stags have four spiracula:</p>
<blockquote>

<p>&ldquo;&Tau;&epsilon;&tau;&rho;&alpha;&delta;&upsilon;&mu;&omicron;&iota;
&rho;&iota;&nu;&epsilon;&sigmaf;, 
&pi;&#943;&sigma;&upsilon;&rho;&epsilon;&sigmaf;

</blockquote>
<p>Writers, copying from one another, make Aristotle say that goats breathe
at their ears; whereas he asserts <!-- page 56--><a name="page56"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 56</span>just the contrary:

<h3>LETTER XV.</h3>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">Selborne</span>, <i>March 
30th</i>, 1768.</p>
<p>Dear Sir,&mdash;Some intelligent country people have a notion that we 
have in these parts a species of the <i>genus mustelinum</i>, besides the 
weasel, stoat, ferret, and polecat; a little reddish beast, not much bigger
than a field-mouse, but much longer, which they call a <i>cane</i>.&nbsp; 
This piece of intelligence can be little depended on; but farther inquiry 
may be made.</p>
<p>A gentleman in this neighbourhood had two milk-white rooks in one 
nest.&nbsp; A booby of a carter, finding them before they were able to fly,
threw them down and destroyed them, to the regret of the owner, who would 
have been glad to have preserved such a curiosity in his rookery.&nbsp; I 
saw the birds myself nailed against the end of a barn, and was surprised to
find that their bills, legs, feet, and claws were milk-white.</p>
<p>A shepherd saw, as he thought, some white larks on <!-- page 57--><a 
name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 57</span>a down above my house 
this winter: were not these the <i>Emberiza nivalis</i>, the snow-flake of 
the Brit. Zool.?&nbsp; No doubt they were.</p>
<p>A few years ago I saw a cock bullfinch in a cage, which had been caught 
in the fields after it was come to its full colours.&nbsp; In about a year 
it began to look dingy; and, blackening every succeeding year, it became 
coal-black at the end of four.&nbsp; Its chief food was hempseed.&nbsp; 
Such influence has food on the colour of animals!&nbsp; The pied and 
mottled colours of domesticated animals are supposed to be owing to high, 
various, and unusual food.</p>
<p>I had remarked, for years, that the root of the cuckoo-pint 
(<i>arum</i>) was frequently scratched out of the dry banks of hedges, and 
eaten in severe snowy weather.&nbsp; After observing, with some exactness, 
myself, and getting others to do the same, we found it was the thrush kind 
that searched it out.&nbsp; The root of the <i>arum</i> is remarkably warm 
and pungent.</p>
<p>Our flocks of female chaffinches have not yet forsaken us.&nbsp; The 
blackbirds and thrushes are very much thinned down by that fierce weather 
in January.</p>
<p>In the middle of February I discovered, in my tall hedges, a little bird
that raised my curiosity: it was of that yellow-green colour that belongs 
to the <i>salicaria</i> kind, and, I think, was soft-billed.&nbsp; It was 
no <i>parus</i>; and was too long and too big for the golden-crowned <!-- 
page 58--><a name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 58</span>wren, 
appearing most like the largest willow-wren.&nbsp; It hung sometimes with 
its back downwards, but never continuing one moment in the same 
place.&nbsp; I shot at it, but it was so desultory that I missed my 
aim.</p>
<p>I wonder that the stone-curlew, <i>Charadrius &oelig;dicnemus</i>, 
should be mentioned by the writers as a rare bird: it abounds in all the 
champaign parts of Hampshire and Sussex, and breeds, I think, all the 
summer, having young ones, I know, very late in the autumn.&nbsp; Already 
they begin clamouring in the evening.&nbsp; They cannot, I think, with any 
propriety, be called, as they are by Mr. Ray, &ldquo;<i>circa aquas 
versantes</i>;&rdquo; for with us, by day at least, they haunt only the 
most dry, open, upland fields and sheep-walks, far removed from water: what
they may do in the night I cannot say.&nbsp; Worms are their usual food, 
but they also eat toads and frogs.</p>
<p>I can show you some good specimens of my new mice.&nbsp; Linn&aelig;us 
perhaps would call the species <i>Mus minimus</i>.</p>
<h3>LETTER XVI.</h3>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">Selborne</span>, <i>April 
18th</i>, 1768.</p>
<p>Dear Sir,&mdash;The history of the stone-curlew, <i>Charadrius 
&oelig;dicnemus</i>, is as follows.&nbsp; It lays its eggs, <!-- page 
59--><a name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 59</span>usually two, 
never more than three, on the bare ground, without any nest, in the field, 
so that the countryman, in stirring his fallows, often destroys them.&nbsp;
The young run immediately from the egg like partridges, etc., and are 
withdrawn to some flinty field by the dam, where they skulk among the 
stones, which are their best security; for their feathers are so exactly of
the colour of our grey-spotted flints, that the most exact observer, unless
he catches the eye of the young bird, may be eluded.&nbsp; The eggs are 
short and round; of a dirty white, spotted with dark bloody blotches.&nbsp;
Though I might not be able, just when I pleased, to procure you a bird, yet
I could show you them almost any day; and any evening you may hear them 
round the village, for they make a clamour which may be heard a mile.&nbsp;
<i>&OElig;dicnemus</i> is a most apt and expressive name for them, since 
their legs seem swollen like those of a gouty man.&nbsp; After harvest I 
have shot them before the pointers in turnip-fields.</p>
<p>I make no doubt but there are three species of the willow-wrens; two I 
know perfectly, but have not been able yet to procure the third.&nbsp; No 
two birds can differ more in their notes, and that constantly, than those 
two that I am acquainted with; for the one has a joyous, easy, laughing 
note, the other a harsh, loud chirp.&nbsp; The former is every way larger, 
and three-quarters of an inch longer, and weighs two drams and <!-- page 
60--><a name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 60</span>a half, while 
the latter weighs but two; so the songster is one-fifth heavier than the 
chirper.&nbsp; The chirper (being the first summer-bird of passage that is 
heard, the wryneck sometimes excepted) begins his two notes in the middle 
of March, and continues them through the spring and summer till the end of 
August, as appears by my journals.&nbsp; The legs of the larger of these 
two are flesh-coloured; of the less black.</p>
<p>The grasshopper-lark began his sibilous note in my fields last 
Saturday.&nbsp; Nothing can be more amusing than the whisper of this little
bird, which seems to be close by though at a hundred yards&rsquo; distance;
and when close at your ear, is scarce any louder than when a great way 
off.&nbsp; Had I not been a little acquainted with insects, and known that 
the grasshopper kind is not yet hatched, I should have hardly believed but 
that it had been a <i>locusta</i> whispering in the bushes.&nbsp; The 
country people laugh when you tell them that it is the note of a 
bird.&nbsp; It is a most artful creature, skulking in the thickest part of 
a bush, and will sing at a yard distance, provided it be concealed.&nbsp; I
was obliged to get a person to go on the other side of the hedge where it 
haunted, and then it would run, creeping like a mouse, before us for a 
hundred yards together, through the bottom of the thorns; yet it would not 
come into fair sight; but in a morning early, and when undisturbed, it 
sings on the top of a twig, gaping and shivering <!-- page 61--><a 
name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 61</span>with its wings.&nbsp; 
Mr. Ray himself had no knowledge of this bird, but received his account 
from Mr. Johnson, who apparently confounds it with the <i>reguli non 
cristati</i>, from which it is very distinct.&nbsp; See Ray&rsquo;s 
&ldquo;Philos. Letters,&rdquo; p. 108.</p>
<p>The fly-catcher (<i>stoparola</i>) has not yet appeared; it usually 
breeds in my vine.&nbsp; The redstart begins to sing, its note is short and
imperfect, but is continued till about the middle of June.&nbsp; The 
willow-wrens (the smaller sort) are horrid pests in a garden, destroying 
the peas, cherries, currants, etc.; and are so tame that a gun will not 
scare them.</p>

<p>My countrymen talk much of a bird that makes a clatter with its bill 
against a dead bough, or some old pales, calling it a jar-bird.&nbsp; I 
procured one to be shot in the very fact; it proved to be the <i>Sitta 
europ&oelig;a</i> (the nuthatch).&nbsp; Mr. Ray says that the less spotted 
woodpecker does the same.&nbsp; This noise may be heard a furlong or 
more.</p>
<p>Now is the only time to ascertain the short-winged summer birds; for, 
when the leaf is out, there is no making any remarks on such a restless 
tribe; and when once the young begin to appear it is all confusion: there 
is no distinction of genus, species, or sex.</p>
<p>In breeding-time snipes play over the moors, piping and humming; they 
always hum as they are descending.&nbsp; Is not their hum ventriloquous 
like that of the turkey?&nbsp; Some suspect it is made by their wings.</p>
<p>This morning I saw the golden-crowned wren, whose crown glitters like 
burnished gold.&nbsp; It often hangs like a titmouse, with its back 
downwards.</p>

63</span>LETTER XVII.</h3>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">Selborne</span>, <i>June 
18th</i>, 1768.</p>
<p>Dear Sir,&mdash;On Wednesday last arrived your agreeable letter of June 
10th.&nbsp; It gives me great satisfaction to find that you pursue these 
studies still with such vigour, and are in such forwardness with regard to 
reptiles and fishes.</p>
<p>The reptiles, few as they are, I am not acquainted with, so well as I 
could wish, with regard to their natural history.&nbsp; There is a degree 
of dubiousness and obscurity attending the propagation of this class of 
animals, something analogous to that of the <i>cryptogamia</i> in the 
sexual system of plants: and the case is the same with regard to some of 
the fishes, as the eel, etc.</p>
<p>The method in which toads procreate and bring forth seems to be very 
much in the dark.&nbsp; Some authors say that they are viviparous, and yet 
Ray classes them among his oviparous animals, and is silent with regard to 
the manner of their bringing forth.&nbsp; Perhaps they may be 
&epsilon;&sigma;&omega; &mu;&epsilon;&nu; 
&omega;&omicron;&tau;&omicron;&kappa;&omicron;&iota;, &epsilon;&xi;&omega; 
&delta;&epsilon; 
&zeta;&omega;&omicron;&tau;&omicron;&kappa;&omicron;&iota;,&nbsp; as is 
known to be the case with the viper.</p>
<p>The copulation of frogs (or at least the appearance of it) is notorious 
to everybody, because we see them sticking upon each other&rsquo;s backs, 
for a month together <!-- page 64--><a name="page64"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 64</span>in the spring: and yet I never saw, or read, of
toads being observed in the same situation.&nbsp; It is strange that the 
matter with regard to the venom of toads has not been yet settled.&nbsp; 
That they are not noxious to some animals is plain, for ducks, buzzards, 
owls, stone-curlews, and snakes, eat them, to my knowledge, with 
impunity.&nbsp; And I well remember the time, but was not eye-witness to 
the fact (though numbers of persons were), when a quack, at this village, 
ate a toad to make the country people stare; afterwards he drank oil.</p>
<p>I have been informed also, from undoubted authority, that some ladies 
(ladies you will say of peculiar taste) took a fancy to a toad, which they 
nourished, summer after summer, for many years, till he grew to a monstrous
size, with the maggots which turn to flesh-flies.&nbsp; The reptile used to
come forth every evening from a hole under the garden steps, and was taken 
up, after supper, on the table to be fed.&nbsp; But at last a tame raven, 
kenning him as he put forth his head, gave him such a severe stroke with 
his horny beak as put out one eye.&nbsp; After this accident the creature 
languished for some time and died.</p>
<p>I need not remind a gentleman of your extensive reading of the excellent
account there is from Mr. Derham, in Ray&rsquo;s &ldquo;Wisdom of God in 
the Creation&rdquo; (p. 365), concerning the migration of frogs from their 
breeding ponds.&nbsp; In this account he at once subverts <!-- page 65--><a
name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 65</span>that foolish opinion of
their dropping from the clouds in rain, showing that it is from the 
grateful coolness and moisture of those showers that they are tempted to 
set out on their travels, which they defer till those fall.&nbsp; Frogs are
as yet in their tadpole state; but, in a few weeks, our lanes, paths, 
fields, will swarm for a few days with myriads of those emigrants, no 
larger than my little finger nail.&nbsp; Swammerdam gives a most accurate 
account of the method and situation in which the male impregnates the spawn
of the female.&nbsp; How wonderful is the economy of Providence with regard
to the limbs of so vile a reptile!&nbsp; While it is an aquatic it has a 
fish-like tail, and no legs; as soon as the legs sprout, the tail drops off
as useless, and the animal betakes itself to the land!</p>
<p>Merret, I trust, is widely mistaken when he advances that the <i>rana 
arborea</i> is an English reptile; it abounds in Germany and 
Switzerland.</p>
<p>It is to be remembered that the <i>salamandra aquatica</i> of Ray (the 
water-newt or eft) will frequently bite at the angler&rsquo;s bait, and is 
often caught on his hook.&nbsp; I used take it for granted that the 
<i>salamandra aquatica</i> was hatched, lived, and died, in the 
water.&nbsp; But John Ellis, Esq., F.R.S. (the coralline Ellis), asserts, 
in a letter to the Royal Society, dated June 5th, 1766, in his account of 
the <i>mud inguana</i>, an amphibious biped from South Carolina, that the 
water-eft, or newt, is <!-- page 66--><a name="page66"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 66</span>only the larva of the land-eft, as tadpoles are
of frogs.&nbsp; Lest I should be suspected to misunderstand his meaning, I 
shall give it in his own words.&nbsp; Speaking of the <i>opercula</i> or 
coverings to the gills of the <i>mud inguana</i>, he proceeds to say that, 
&ldquo;The form of these pennated coverings approaches very near to what I 
have some time ago observed in the larva or aquatic state of our&nbsp; 
English <i>lacerta</i>, known by the name of eft, or newt, which serve them
for coverings to their gills, and for fins to swim with while in this 
state; and which they lose, as well as the fins of their tails, when they 
change their state and become land animals, as I have observed, by keeping 
them alive for some time myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Linn&aelig;us, in his &ldquo;Systema Natur&aelig;,&rdquo; hints at what 
Mr. Ellis advances more than once.</p>
<p>Providence has been so indulgent to us as to allow of but one venomous 
reptile of the serpent kind in these kingdoms, and that is the viper.&nbsp;
As you propose the good of mankind to be an object of your publications you
will not omit to mention common salad-oil as sovereign remedy against the 
bite of the viper.&nbsp; A to the blind worm (<i>anguis fragilis</i>, 
so-called because it snaps in sunder with a small blow), I have found, on 
examination, that it is perfectly innocuous.&nbsp; A neighbouring yeoman 
(to whom I am indebted for some good hints) killed and opened a female 
viper about the 27th May: he found her filled with a chain <!-- page 
67--><a name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 67</span>of eleven eggs,
about the size of those of a blackbird; but none of them were advanced so 
far towards a state of maturity as to contain any rudiments of young.&nbsp;
Though they are oviparous, yet they are viviparous also, hatching their 
young within their bellies, and then bringing them forth.&nbsp; Whereas 
snakes lay chains of eggs every summer in my melon beds, in spite of all 
that my people can do to prevent them; which eggs do not hatch till the 
spring following, as I have often experienced.&nbsp; Several intelligent 
folks assure me that they have seen the viper open her mouth and admit her 
helpless young down her throat on sudden surprises, just as the female 
opossum does her brood into the pouch under her belly, upon the like 
emergencies; and yet the London viper-catchers insist on it, to Mr. 
Barrington, that no such thing ever happens.&nbsp; The serpent kind eat, I 
believe, but once in a year; or rather, but only just at one season of the 
year.&nbsp; Country people talk much of a water-snake, but, I am pretty 
sure, without any reason; for the common snake (<i>coluber natrix</i>) 
delights much to sport in the water, perhaps with a view to procure frogs 
and other food.</p>
<p>I cannot well guess how you are to make out your twelve species of 
reptiles, unless it be by the various species, or rather varieties, of our 
<i>lacerti</i>, of which Ray enumerates five.&nbsp; I have not had 
opportunity of ascertaining these; but remember well to have seen <!-- page
68--><a name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 68</span>formerly 
several beautiful green <i>lacerti</i> on the sunny sandbanks near Farnham,
in Surrey; and Ray admits there are such in Ireland.</p>
<h3>LETTER XVIII.</h3>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">Selborne</span>, <i>July 
27th</i>, 1768.</p>
<p>Dear Sir,&mdash;I received your obliging and communicative letter of 
June 28th, while I was on a visit at a gentleman&rsquo;s house, where I had
neither books to turn to nor leisure to sit down, to return you an answer 
to many queries, which I wanted to resolve in the best manner that I am 
able.</p>
<p>A person, by my order, has searched our brooks, but could find no such 
fish as the <i>gasterosteus pungitius</i>; he found the <i>gasterosteus 
aculeatus</i> in plenty.&nbsp; This morning, in a basket, I packed a little
earthen pot full of wet moss, and in it some sticklebacks, male and female,
the females big with spawn; some lamperns; some bull&rsquo;s heads; but I 
could procure no minnows.&nbsp; This basket will be in Fleet Street by 
eight this evening; so I hope Mazel will have them fresh and fair to-morrow
morning.&nbsp; I gave some directions, in a letter, to what particulars the
engraver should be attentive.</p>
<p><!-- page 69--><a name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
69</span>Finding, while I was on a visit, that I was within a reasonable 
distance of Ambresbury, I sent a servant over to that town, and procured 
several living specimens of loaches, which he brought, safe and brisk, in a
glass decanter.&nbsp; They were taken in the gullies that were cut for 
watering the meadows.&nbsp; From these fishes (which measured from two to 
four inches in length) I took the following description: &ldquo;The loach, 
in its general aspect, has a pellucid appearance; its back is mottled with 
irregular collections of small black dots, not reaching much below the 
<i>linea lateralis</i>, as are the back and tail fins; a black line runs 
from each eye down to the nose; its belly is of a silvery white; the upper 
jaw projects beyond the lower, and is surrounded with six feelers, three on
each side; its pectoral fins are large, its ventral much smaller; the fin 
behind its anus small; its dorsal-fin large, containing eight spines; its 
tail, where it joins to the tail-fin, remarkably broad, without any 
taperness, so as to be characteristic of this genus; the tail-fin is broad,
and square at the end.&nbsp; From the breadth and muscular strength of the 
tail it appears to be an active, nimble fish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In my visit I was not very far from Hungerford, and did not forget to 
make some inquiries concerning the wonderful method of curing cancers by 
means of toads.&nbsp; Several intelligent persons, both gentry and clergy, 
do <!-- page 70--><a name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 70</span>I 
find give a great deal of credit to what is asserted in the papers, and I 
myself dined with a clergyman who seemed to be persuaded that what is 
related is matter of fact; but, when I came to attend to his account, I 
thought I discerned circumstances which did not a little invalidate the 
woman&rsquo;s story of the manner in which she came by her skill.&nbsp; She
says of herself, &ldquo;that, labouring under a virulent cancer, she went 
to some church where there was a vast crowd; on going into a pew, she was 
accosted by a strange clergyman, who, after expressing compassion for her 
situation, told her that if she would make such an application of living 
toads as is mentioned she would be well.&rdquo;&nbsp; Now is it likely that
this unknown gentleman should express so much tenderness for this single 
sufferer, and not feel any for the many thousands that daily languish under
this terrible disorder?&nbsp; Would he not have made use of this invaluable
nostrum for his own emolument; or at least, by some means of publication or
other, have found a method of making it public for the good of 
mankind?&nbsp; In short, this woman (as it appears to me), having set up 
for a cancer-doctress, finds it expedient to amuse the country with this 
dark and mysterious relation.</p>
<p>The water-eft has not, that I can discern, the least appearance of any 
gills; for want of which it is continually rising to the surface of the 
water to take in <!-- page 71--><a name="page71"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 71</span>fresh air.&nbsp; I opened a big-bellied one 
indeed, and found it full of spawn.&nbsp; Not that this circumstance at all
invalidates the assertion that they are <i>larv&aelig;</i>, for the 
<i>larv&aelig;</i> of insects are full of eggs, which they exclude the 
instant they enter their last state.&nbsp; The water-eft is continually 
climbing over the brims of the vessel, within which we keep it in water, 
and wandering away; and people every summer see numbers crawling out of the
pools where they are hatched up the dry banks.&nbsp; There are varieties of
them, differing in colour; and some have fins up their tail and back, and 
some have not.</p>
<h3>LETTER XIX.</h3>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">Selborne</span>, <i>August
17th</i>, 1768</p>
<p>Dear Sir,&mdash;I have now, past dispute, made out three distinct 
species of the willow-wrens (<i>motacill&aelig; trochili</i>) which 
constantly and invariably use distinct notes.&nbsp; But at the same time I 
am obliged to confess that I know nothing of your willow-lark.&nbsp; In my 
letter of April 18th, I had told you peremptorily that I knew your 
willow-lark, but had not seen it then; but when I came to procure it, it 
proved in all respects a very <i>motacilla trochilus</i>, only that it is a
size larger than <!-- page 72--><a name="page72"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 72</span>the two other, and the yellow-green of the 
whole upper part of the body is more vivid, and the belly of a clearer 
white.&nbsp; I have specimens of the three sorts now lying before me, and 
can discern that there are three gradations of sizes, and that the least 
has black legs, and the other two flesh-coloured ones.&nbsp; The yellowest 
bird is considerably the largest, and has its quill-feathers and secondary 
feathers tipped with white, which the others have not.&nbsp; This last 
haunts only the tops of trees in high beechen woods, and makes a sibilous 
grasshopper-like noise, now and then, at short intervals, shivering a 
little with its wings when it sings; and is, I make no doubt now, the 
<i>regulus non cristatus</i> of Ray, which he says &ldquo;<i>cantat voce 
stridul&acirc; locust&aelig;</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Yet this great ornithologist
never suspected that there were three species.</p>
<h3>LETTER XX.</h3>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">Selborne</span>, 
<i>October 8th</i>, 1768.</p>
<p>It is I find in zoology as it is in botany; all nature is so full that 
that district produces the greatest variety which is the most 
examined.&nbsp; Several birds, which are said to belong to the north only, 
are it seems often in the south.&nbsp; I have discovered this summer three 
<!-- page 73--><a name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
73</span>species of birds with us, which writers mention as only to be seen
in the northern counties.&nbsp; The first that was brought me (on the 14th 
May) was the sand-piper, <i>tringa hypoleucus</i>: it was a cock bird, and 
haunted the banks of some ponds near the village; and, as it had a 
companion, doubtless intended to have bred near that water.&nbsp; Besides, 
the owner has told me since that, on recollection, he has seen some of the 
same birds round his ponds in former summers.</p>
<p>The next bird that I procured (on the 21st May) was a male red-backed 
butcher bird, <i>lanius collurio</i>.&nbsp; My neighbour, who shot it, says
that it might easily have escaped his notice, had not the outcries and 
chattering of the whitethroats and other small birds drawn his attention to
the bush where it was; its craw was filled with the legs and wings of 
beetles.</p>
<p>The next rare birds (which were procured for me last week) were some 
ring-ousels, <i>turdi torquati</i>.</p>
<p>This week twelve months a gentleman from London, being with us, was 
amusing himself with a gun, and found, he told us, on an old yew hedge 
where there were berries, some birds like blackbirds, with rings of white 
round their necks: a neighbouring farmer also at the same time observed the
same; but, as no specimens were procured, little notice was taken.&nbsp; I 
mentioned this circumstance to you in my letter of November 4th, 1767 (you,
however, paid but small <!-- page 74--><a name="page74"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 74</span>regard to what I said, as I had not seen these 
birds myself); but last week the aforesaid farmer, seeing a large flock, 
twenty or thirty of these birds, shot two cocks and two hens, and says, on 
recollection, that he remembers to have observed these birds again last 
spring, about Lady-day, as it were on their return to the north.&nbsp; Now 
perhaps these ousels are not the ousels of the north of England, but belong
to the more northern parts of Europe, and may retire before the excessive 
rigour of the frosts in those parts, and return to breed in the spring, 
when the cold abates.&nbsp; If this be the case, here is discovered a new 
bird of winter passage, concerning whose migrations the writers are silent;
but if these birds should prove the ousels of the north of England, then 
here is a migration disclosed within our own kingdom never before 
remarked.&nbsp; It does not yet appear whether they retire beyond the 
bounds of our island to the south; but it is most probable that they 
usually do, or else one cannot suppose that they would have continued so 
long unnoticed in the southern countries.&nbsp; The ousel is larger than a 
blackbird, and feeds on haws; but last autumn (when there were no haws) it 
fed on yew-berries: in the spring it feeds on ivy-berries, which ripen only
at that season, in March and April.</p>
<p>I must not omit to tell you (as you have been so lately on the study of 
reptiles) that my people, every <!-- page 75--><a name="page75"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 75</span>now and then of late, draw up with a bucket of 
water from my well, which is sixty-three feet deep, a large black warty 
lizard with a fin-tail and yellow belly.&nbsp; How they first came down at 
that depth, and how they were ever to have got out thence without help, is 
more than I am able to say.</p>
<p>My thanks are due to you for your trouble and care in the examination of
a buck&rsquo;s head.&nbsp; As far as your discoveries reach at present, 
they seem much to corroborate my suspicions; and I hope Mr. --- may find 
reason to give his decision in my favour; and then, I think, we may advance
this extraordinary provision of nature as a new instance of the wisdom of 
God in the creation.</p>
<p>As yet I have not quite done with my history of the 
<i>&oelig;dicnemus</i>, or stone-curlew; for I shall desire a gentleman in 
Sussex (near whose house these birds congregate in vast flocks in the 
autumn) to observe nicely when they leave him (if they do leave him), and 
when they return again in the spring: I was with this gentleman lately, and
saw several single birds.</p>
<h3><!-- page 76--><a name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
76</span>LETTER XXI.</h3>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">Selborne</span>, <i>Nov. 
28th</i>, 1768.</p>
<p>Dear Sir,&mdash;With regard to the <i>&oelig;dicnemus</i>, or 
stone-curlew, I intend to write very soon to my friend near Chichester, in 
whose neighbourhood these birds seem most to abound, and shall urge him to 
take particular notice when they begin to congregate, and afterwards to 
watch them most narrowly whether they do not withdraw themselves during the
dead of the winter.&nbsp; When I have obtained information with respect to 
this circumstance, I shall have finished my history of the stone-curlew, 
which I hope will prove to your satisfaction, as it will be, I trust, very 
near the truth.&nbsp; This gentleman, as he occupies a large farm of his 
own, and is abroad early and late, will be a very proper spy upon the 
motions of these birds; and besides, as I have prevailed on him to buy the 
Naturalist&rsquo;s Journal (with which he is much delighted), I shall 
expect that he will be very exact in his dates.&nbsp; It is very 
extraordinary, as you observe, that a bird so common with us should never 
struggle to you.</p>
<p>And here will be the properest place to mention, while I think of it, an
anecdote which the above-mentioned gentleman told me when I was last at his
house; which was that, in a warren joining to his <!-- page 77--><a 
name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 77</span>outlet, many daws 
(<i>corvi monedul&oelig;</i>) build every year in the rabbit-burrows under 
ground.&nbsp; The way he and his brothers used to take their nests, while 
they were boys, was by listening at the mouths of the holes, and, if they 
heard the young ones cry, they twisted the nest out with a forked 
stick.&nbsp; Some water-fowls (viz., the puffins) breed, I know, in that 
manner; but I should never have suspected the daws of building in holes on 
the flat ground.</p>
<p>Another very unlikely spot is made use of by daws as a place to breed 
in, and that is Stonehenge.&nbsp; These birds deposit their nests in the 
interstices between the upright and the impost stones of that amazing work 
of antiquity; which circumstance alone speaks the prodigious height of the 
upright stones, that they should be tall enough to secure those nests from 
the annoyance of shepherd-boys, who are always idling round that place.</p>
<p>One of my neighbours last Saturday, November 26th, saw a martin in a 
sheltered bottom: the sun shone warm, and the bird was hawking briskly 
after flies.&nbsp; I am now perfectly satisfied that they do not all leave 
this island in the winter.</p>
<p>You judge very right, I think, in speaking with reserve and caution 
concerning the cures done by toads; for, let people advance what they will 
on such subjects, yet there is such a propensity in mankind <!-- page 
78--><a name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 78</span>towards 
deceiving and being deceived, that one cannot safely relate anything from 
common report, especially in print, without expressing some degree of doubt
and suspicion.</p>
<p>Your approbation with regard to my new discovery of the migration of the
ring-ousel gives me satisfaction; and I find you concur with me in 
suspecting that they are foreign birds which visit us.&nbsp; You will be 
sure, I hope, not to omit to make inquiry whether your ring-ousels leave 
your rocks in the autumn.&nbsp; What puzzles me most is the very short stay
they make with us, for in about three weeks they are all gone.&nbsp; I 
shall be very curious to remark whether they will call on us at their 
return in the spring, as they did last year.</p>
<p>I want to be better informed with regard to ichthyology.&nbsp; If 
fortune had settled me near the seaside, or near some great river, my 
natural propensity would soon have urged me to have made myself acquainted 
with their productions; but as I have lived mostly in inland parts, and in 
an upland district, my knowledge of fishes extends little farther than to 
those common sorts which our brooks and lakes produce.</p>

79</span>LETTER XXII.</h3>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">Selborne</span>, <i>Jan. 
2nd</i>, 1769.</p>
<p>Dear Sir,&mdash;As to the peculiarity of jackdaws building with us under
the ground in rabbit-burrows, you have, in part, hit upon the reason; for, 
in reality, there are hardly any towers or steeples in all this 
county.&nbsp; And perhaps, Norfolk excepted, Hampshire and Sussex are as 
meanly furnished with churches as almost any counties in the kingdom.&nbsp;
We have many livings of two or three hundred pounds a year, whose houses of
worship make little better appearance than dovecots.&nbsp; When I first saw
Northamptonshire, Cambridgeshire, and Huntingdonshire, and the fens of 
Lincolnshire, I was amazed at the number of spires which presented 
themselves in every point of view.&nbsp; As an admirer of prospects, I have
reason to lament this want in my own county; for such objects are very 
necessary ingredients in an elegant landscape.</p>
<p>What you mention with respect to reclaimed toads raises my 
curiosity.&nbsp; An ancient author, though no naturalist, has well remarked
that &ldquo;every kind of beasts, and of birds, and of serpents, and things
in the sea, is tamed, and hath been tamed, of mankind.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 80--><a name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 80</span>It
is a satisfaction to me to find that a green lizard has actually been 
procured for you in Devonshire, because it corroborates my discovery, which
I made many years ago, of the same sort, on a sunny sandbank near Farnham, 
in Surrey.&nbsp; I am well acquainted with the South Hams of Devonshire, 
and can suppose that district, from its southerly situation, to be a proper
habitation for such animals in their best colours.</p>
<p>Since the ring-ousels of your vast mountains do certainly not forsake 
them against winter, our suspicions that those which visit this 
neighbourhood about Michaelmas are not English birds, but driven from the 
more northern parts of Europe by the frosts, are still more reasonable; and
it will be worth your pains to endeavour to trace from whence they come, 
and to inquire why they make so very short a stay.</p>
<p>In your account of your error with regard to the two species of herons, 
you incidentally gave me great entertainment in your description of the 
heronry at Cressi Hall, which is a curiosity I never could manage to 
see.&nbsp; Fourscore nests of such a bird on one tree is a rarity which I 
would ride half as many miles to have a sight of.&nbsp; Pray be sure to 
tell me in your next whose seat Cressi Hall is, and near what town it 
lies.&nbsp; I have often thought that those vast extents of fens <!-- page 
81--><a name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 81</span>have never been
sufficiently explored.&nbsp; If half a dozen gentlemen, furnished with a 
good strength of water-spaniels, were to beat them over for a week, they 
would certainly find more species.</p>
<p>There is no bird, I believe, whose manners I have studied more than that
of the <i>caprimulgus</i> (the goat-sucker), as it is a wonderful and 
curious creature; but I have always found that though sometimes it may 
chatter as it flies, as I know it does, yet in general it utters its 
jarring note sitting on a bough; and I have for many a half hour watched it
as it sat with its under mandible quivering, and particularly this 
summer.&nbsp; It perches usually on a bare twig, with its head lower than 
its tail, in an attitude well expressed by your draughtsman in the folio 
&ldquo;British Zoology.&rdquo;&nbsp; This bird is most punctual in 
beginning its song exactly at the close of day&mdash;so exactly that I have
known it strike up more than once or twice just at the report of the 
Portsmouth evening gun, which we can hear when the weather is still.&nbsp; 
It appears to me past all doubt that its notes are formed by organic 
impulse, by the powers of the parts of its windpipe formed for sound, just 
as cats purr.&nbsp; You will credit me, I hope, when I assure you that, as 
my neighbours were assembled in an hermitage on the side of a steep hill 
where we drink tea, one of these churn-owls came and settled on the cross 
of that little straw edifice and began to <!-- page 82--><a 
name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 82</span>chatter, and continued 
his note for many minutes: and we were all struck with wonder to find that 
the organs of that little animal, when put in motion, gave a sensible 
vibration to the whole building!&nbsp; This bird also sometimes makes a 
small squeak, repeated four or five times; and I have observed that to 
happen when the cock has been pursuing the hen in a toying way through the 
boughs of a tree.</p>
<p>It would not be at all strange if your bat, which you have procured, 
should prove a new one, since five species have been found in a 
neighbouring kingdom.&nbsp; The great sort that I mentioned is certainly a 
nondescript; I saw but one this summer, and that I had no opportunity of 
taking.</p>
<p>Your account of the Indian grass was entertaining.&nbsp; I am no angler 
myself; but inquiring of those that are, what they supposed that part of 
their tackle to be made of?&mdash;they replied, &ldquo;Of the intestines of
a silkworm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Though I must not pretend to great skill in entomology, yet I cannot say
that I am ignorant of that kind of knowledge; I may now and then perhaps be
able to furnish you with a little information.</p>
<p>The vast rains ceased with us much about the same time as with you, and 
since we have had delicate weather.&nbsp; Mr. Barker, who has measured the 
rain for <!-- page 83--><a name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
83</span>more than thirty years, says, in a late letter, that more has 
fallen this year than in any he ever attended to; though from July, 1763, 
to January, 1764, more fell than in any seven months of this year.</p>
<h3>LETTER XXIII.</h3>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">Selborne</span>, <i>Feb. 
28th</i>, 1769.</p>
<p>Dear Sir,&mdash;It is not improbable that the Guernsey lizard and our 
green lizards may be specifically the same; all that I know is, that, when 
some years ago many Guernsey lizards were turned loose in Pembroke College 
garden, in the University of Oxford, they lived a great while, and seemed 
to enjoy themselves very well, but never bred.&nbsp; Whether this 
circumstance will prove anything either way I shall not pretend to say.</p>
<p>I return you thanks for your account of Cressi Hall; but recollect, not 
without regret, that in June, 1746, I was visiting for a week together at 
Spalding, without ever being told that such a curiosity was just at 
hand.&nbsp; Pray send me word in your next what sort of tree it is that 
contains such a quantity of herons&rsquo; nests, <!-- page 84--><a 
name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 84</span>and whether the heronry
consists of a whole grove of wood, or only of a few trees.</p>
<p>It gave me satisfaction to find we accorded so well about the 
<i>caprimulgus</i>; all I contended for was to prove that it often chatters
sitting as well as flying; and therefore the noise was voluntary, and from 
organic impulse, and not from the resistance of the air against the hollow 
of its mouth and throat.</p>
<p>If ever I saw anything like actual migration, it was last Michaelmas 
Day.&nbsp; I was travelling, and out early in the morning; at first there 
was a vast fog, but, by the time that I was got seven or eight miles from 
home towards the coast, the sun broke out into a delicate warm day.&nbsp; 
We were then on a large heath or common, and I could discern, as the mist 
began to break away, great numbers of swallows (<i>hirundines 
rustic&aelig;</i>) clustering on the stunted shrubs and bushes, as if they 
had roosted there all night.&nbsp; As soon as the air became clear and 
pleasant they were all on the wing at once; and, by a placid and easy 
flight, proceeded on southward towards the sea; after this I did not see 
any more flocks, only now and then a straggler.</p>
<p>I cannot agree with those persons that assert that the swallow kind 
disappear some and some gradually, as they come, for the bulk of them seem 
to withdraw at once; only some stragglers stay behind a long while, and do 
never, there is the greatest reason to believe, <!-- page 85--><a 
name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 85</span>leave this 
island.&nbsp; Swallows seem to lay themselves up, and to come forth in a 
warm day, as bats do continually of a warm evening, after they have 
disappeared for weeks.&nbsp; For a very respectable gentleman assured me 
that, as he was walking with some friends under Merton Wall on a remarkably
hot noon, either in the last week in December or the first week in January,
he espied three or four swallows huddled together on the moulding of one of
the windows of that college.&nbsp; I have frequently remarked that swallows
are seen later at Oxford than elsewhere; is it owing to the vast massy 
buildings of that place, to the many waters round it, or to what else?</p>
<p>When I used to rise in the morning last autumn, and see the swallows and
martins clustering on the chimneys and thatch of the neighbouring cottages,
I could not help being touched with a secret delight, mixed with some 
degree of mortification; with delight, to observe with how much ardour and 
punctuality those poor little birds obeyed the strong impulse towards 
migration, or hiding, imprinted on their minds by their great Creator; and 
with some degree of mortification when I reflected that, after all our 
pains and inquiries, we are yet not quite certain to what regions they do 
migrate, and are still farther embarrassed to find that some do not 
actually migrate at all.</p>
<p>These reflections made so strong an impression on <!-- page 86--><a 
name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 86</span>my imagination, that 
they became productive of a composition that may perhaps amuse you for a 
quarter of an hour when next I have the honour of writing to you.</p>
<h3>LETTER XXIV.</h3>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">Selborne</span>, <i>May 
29th</i>, 1769.</p>
<p>Dear Sir,&mdash;The <i>scarab&oelig;us fullo</i> I know very well, 
having seen it in collections, but have never been able to discover one 
wild in its natural state.&nbsp; Mr. Banks told me he thought it might be 
found on the sea-coast.</p>
<p>On the 13th April I went to the sheep-down, where the <i>ring-ousels</i>
have been observed to make their appearance at spring and fall, in their 
way perhaps to the north or south, and was much pleased to see these birds 
about the usual spot.&nbsp; We shot a cock and a hen; they were plump and 
in high condition.&nbsp; The hen had but very small rudiments of eggs 
within her, which proves they are late breeders; whereas those species of 
the thrush kind that remain with us the whole year have fledged young 
before that time.&nbsp; In their crops was nothing very distinguishable, 
but somewhat that seemed like blades of vegetables nearly digested.&nbsp; 
In <!-- page 87--><a name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
87</span>autumn they feed on haws and yew-berries, and in the spring on 
ivy-berries.&nbsp; I dressed one of these birds, and found it juicy and 
well-flavoured.&nbsp; It is remarkable that they make but a few days&rsquo;
stay in their spring visit, but rest near a fortnight at Michaelmas.&nbsp; 
These birds, from the observations of three springs and two autumns, are 
most punctual in their return, and exhibit a new migration unnoticed by the
writers, who supposed they never were to be seen in any southern 
countries.</p>
<p>One of my neighbours lately brought me a new <i>salicaria</i>, which at 
first I suspected might have proved your willow-lark, but, on a nicer 
examination, it answered much better to the description of that species 
which you shot at Revesby, in Lincolnshire.&nbsp; My bird I describe thus: 
&ldquo;It is a size less than the grasshopper-lark; the head, back, and 
coverts of the wings, of a dusky brown, without those dark spots of the 
grasshopper-lark; over each eye is a milk-white stroke; the chin and throat
are white; and the under parts of a yellowish white; the rump is tawny, and
the feathers of the tail sharp-pointed; the bill is dusky and sharp, and 
the legs are dusky; the hinder claw long and crooked.&rdquo;&nbsp; The 
person that shot it says that it sung so like a reed sparrow that he took 
it for one; and that it sings all night: but this account merits farther 
inquiry.&nbsp; For my part I suspect it is a second sort of 
<i>locustela</i>, <!-- page 88--><a name="page88"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 88</span>hinted at by Dr. Derham in Ray&rsquo;s Letters:
see p. 108.&nbsp; He also procured me a grasshopper-lark.</p>
<p>The question that you put with regard to those genera of animals that 
are peculiar to America, viz., how they came there, and whence? is too 
puzzling for me to answer, and yet so obvious as often to have struck me 
with wonder.&nbsp; If one looks into the writers on that subject, little 
satisfaction is to be found.&nbsp; Ingenious men will readily advance 
plausible arguments to support whatever theory they shall choose to 
maintain; but then the misfortune is, every one&rsquo;s hypothesis is each 
as good as another&rsquo;s, since they are all founded on conjecture.&nbsp;
The late writers of this sort, in whom may be seen all the arguments of 
those that have gone before, as I remember, stock America from the western 
coast of Africa and the south of Europe, and then break down the Isthmus 
that bridged over the Atlantic.&nbsp; But this is making use of a violent 
piece of machinery; it is a difficulty worthy of the interposition of a 
god!&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>Incredulus odi</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">Selborne</span>, <i>Aug. 
30th</i>, 1769.</p>
<p>Dear Sir,&mdash;It gives me satisfaction to find that my account of the 
<i>ousel migration</i> pleases you.&nbsp; You put a very shrewd question 
when you ask me how I know that their autumnal migration is 
southward?&nbsp; Was not candour and openness the very life of natural 
history, I should pass over this query just as a sly commentator does over 
a crabbed passage in a classic; but common ingenuousness obliges me to 
confess, not without some degree of shame, that I only reasoned in that 
case from analogy.&nbsp; For as all other autumnal birds migrate from the 
northward to us, to partake of our milder winters, and return to the 
northward again when the rigorous cold abates, so I concluded that the 
ring-ousels did the same, as well as their congeners the fieldfares; and 
especially as ring-ousels are known to haunt cold mountainous countries: 
but I have good reason to suspect, since, that they may come to us from the
westward, because I hear from very good authority, that they breed on 
Dartmoor, and that they forsake that wild district about the time that our 
visitors appear, and do not return till late in the spring.</p>
<p>I have taken a great deal of pains about your <i>salicaria</i> and mine,
with a white stroke over its eye <!-- page 92--><a name="page92"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 92</span>and a tawny rump.&nbsp; I have surveyed it 
alive and dead, and have procured several specimens, and am perfectly 
persuaded myself (and trust you will soon become convinced of the same) 
that it is no more nor less than the <i>passer arundinaceus minor</i> of 
Ray.&nbsp; This bird, by some means or other, seems to be entirely omitted 
in the British Zoology; and one reason probably was because it is so 
strangely classed in Ray, who ranges it among his <i>picis 
affines</i>.&nbsp; It ought, no doubt, to have gone among his 
<i>avicul&aelig; caud&acirc; unicolore</i>, and among your slender-billed 
small birds of the same division.&nbsp; Linn&aelig;us might with great 
propriety have put it into his genus of <i>motacilla</i>; and <i>motacilla 
salicaria</i> of his <i>fauna suecica</i> seems to come the nearest to 
it.&nbsp; It is no uncommon bird, haunting the sides of ponds and rivers 
where there is covert, and the reeds and sedges of moors.&nbsp; The country
people in some places call it the sedge-bird.&nbsp; It sings incessantly 
night and day during the breeding-time, imitating the note of a sparrow, a 
swallow, a skylark, and has a strange hurrying manner in its song.&nbsp; My
specimens correspond most minutely to the description of your <i>fen 
salicaria</i> shot near Revesby.&nbsp; Mr. Ray has given an excellent 
characteristic of it when he says, &ldquo;<i>Rostrum et pedes in h&acirc;c 
avicul&acirc; mult&ograve; majores sunt qu&acirc;m pro corporis 
ratione</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; See letter, May 29th, 1769.&nbsp; (Preceding 
letter xxiv.)</p>
<p><!-- page 93--><a name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 93</span>I 
have got you the egg of an <i>&oelig;dicnemus</i>, or stone-curlew, which 
was picked up in a fallow on the naked ground.&nbsp; There were two, but 
the finder inadvertently crushed one with his foot before he saw them.</p>
<p>When I wrote to you last year on reptiles, I wish I had not forgot to 
mention the faculty that snakes have of stinking <i>se 
defendendo</i>.&nbsp; I knew a gentleman who kept a tame snake, which was 
in its person as sweet as any animal while in good humour and unalarmed, 
but as soon as a stranger, or a dog or cat, came in, it fell to hissing, 
and filled the room with such nauseous effluvia as rendered it hardly 
supportable.&nbsp; Thus the squnck, or stonck, of Ray&rsquo;s &ldquo;Synop.
Quadr.&rdquo; is an innocuous and sweet animal; but, when pressed hard by 
dogs and men, it can eject such a most pestilent and fetid smell and 
excrement, that nothing can be more horrible.</p>
<p>A gentleman sent me lately a fine specimen of the <i>lanius minor 
cinerascens cum macul&acirc; in scapulis alb&acirc;</i>, <i>Raii</i>; which
is a bird that, at the time of your publishing your two first volumes of 
&ldquo;British Zoology,&rdquo; I find you had not seen.&nbsp; You have 
described it well from Edwards&rsquo;s drawing.</p>
<h3><!-- page 94--><a name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
94</span>LETTER XXVI.</h3>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">Selborne</span>, 
<i>December 8th</i>, 1769.</p>
<p>Dear Sir,&mdash;I was much gratified by your communicative letter on 
your return from Scotland, where you spent some considerable time, and gave
yourself good room to examine the natural curiosities of that extensive 
kingdom, both those of the islands, as well as those of the 
highlands.&nbsp; The usual bane of such expeditions is hurry, because men 
seldom allot themselves half the time they should do, but, fixing on a day 
for their return, post from place to place, rather as if they were on a 
journey that required despatch than as philosophers investigating the works
of nature.&nbsp; You must have made, no doubt, many discoveries, and laid 
up a good fund of materials for a future edition of the &ldquo;British 
Zoology;&rdquo; and will have no reason to repent that you have bestowed so
much pains on a part of Great Britain that perhaps was never so well 
examined before.</p>
<p>It has always been matter of wonder to me that fieldfares, which are so 
congenerous to thrushes and blackbirds, should never choose to breed in 
England; but that they should not think even the highlands cold and 
northerly, and sequestered enough, is a circumstance still more strange and
wonderful.&nbsp; The <!-- page 95--><a name="page95"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 95</span>ring-ousel, you find, stays in Scotland the 
whole year round, so that we have reason to conclude that those migrators 
that visit us for a short space every autumn do not come from thence.</p>
<p>And here, I think, will be the proper place to mention that those birds 
were most punctual again in their migration this autumn, appearing, as 
before, about the 30th September; but their flocks were larger than common,
and their stay protracted somewhat beyond the usual time.&nbsp; If they 
came to spend the whole winter with us, as some of their congeners do, and 
then left us, as they do, in spring, I should not be so much struck with 
the occurrence, since it would be similar to that of the other winter birds
of passage; but when I see them for a fortnight at Michaelmas, and again 
for about a week in the middle of April, I am seized with wonder, and long 
to be informed whence these travellers come, and whither they go, since 
they seem to use our hills merely as an inn or baiting place.</p>
<p>Your account of the greater brambling, or snow-fleck, is very amusing; 
and strange it is that such a short-winged bird should delight in such 
perilous voyages over the northern ocean.&nbsp; Some country people in the 
winter time have, every now and then, told me that they have seen two or 
three white larks on our downs, but, on considering the matter, I begin to 
<!-- page 96--><a name="page96"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
96</span>suspect that these are some stragglers of the birds we are talking
of, which sometimes perhaps may rove so far to the southward.</p>
<p>It pleases me to find that white hares are so frequent on the Scottish 
mountains, and especially as you inform me that it is a distinct species, 
for the quadrupeds of Britain are so few, that every new species is a great
acquisition.</p>
<p>The eagle-owl, could it be proved to belong to us, is so majestic a 
bird, that it would grace our <i>fauna</i> much.&nbsp; I never was informed
before where wild geese are known to breed.</p>
<p>You admit, I find, that I have proved your <i>fen salicaria</i> to be 
the lesser reed-sparrow of Ray; and I think you may be secure that I am 
right, for I took very particular pains to clear up that matter, and had 
some fair specimens, but, as they were not well preserved, they are decayed
already.&nbsp; You will, no doubt, insert it in its proper place in your 
next edition.&nbsp; Your additional plates will much improve your work.</p>
<p>De Buffon, I know, has described the water shrew-mouse; but still I am 
pleased to find you have discovered it in Lincolnshire, for the reason I 
have given in the article of the white hare.</p>
<p>As a neighbour was lately ploughing a dry, chalky field, far removed 
from any water, he turned out a water-rat, that was curiously lain up in a 
hybernaculum <!-- page 97--><a name="page97"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
97</span>artificially formed of grass and leaves.&nbsp; At one end of the 
burrow lay above a gallon of potatoes regularly stowed, on which it was to 
have supported itself for the winter.&nbsp; But the difficulty with me is 
how this <i>amphibius mus</i> came to fix its winter station at such a 
distance from the water.&nbsp; Was it determined in its choice of that 
place by the mere accident of finding the potatoes which were planted 
there, or is it the constant practice of the aquatic rat to forsake the 
neighbourhood of the water in the colder months?</p>
<p>Though I delight very little in analogous reasoning, knowing how 
fallacious it is with respect to natural history, yet, in the following 
instance, I cannot help being inclined to think it may conduce towards the 
explanation of a difficulty that I have mentioned before, with respect to 
the invariable early retreat of the <i>hirundo apus</i>, or swift, so many 
weeks before its congeners; and that not only with us, but also in 
Andalusia, where they also begin to retire about the beginning of 
August.</p>
<p>The great large bat (which, by-the-bye, is at present a nondescript in 
England, and what I have never been able yet to procure) retires or 
migrates very early in the summer.&nbsp; It also ranges very high for its 
food, feeding in a different region of the air, and that is the reason I 
never could procure one.&nbsp; Now this is exactly the case with the 
swifts; for they take their food in a <!-- page 98--><a 
name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 98</span>more exalted region 
than the other species, and are very seldom seen hawking for flies near the
ground, or over the surface of the water.&nbsp; From hence I would conclude
that these <i>hirundines</i> and the larger bats are supported by some 
sorts of high-flying gnats, scarabs, or <i>phal&oelig;n&aelig;</i>, that 
are of short continuance, and that the short stay of these strangers is 
regulated by the defect of their food.</p>
<p>By my journal it appears that curlews clamoured on to October 31st, 
since which I have not seen nor heard any.&nbsp; Swallows were observed on 
to November 3rd.</p>
<h3>LETTER XXVII.</h3>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">Selborne</span>, <i>Feb. 
22nd</i>, 1770.</p>
<p>Dear Sir,&mdash;Hedgehogs abound in my gardens and fields.&nbsp; The 
manner in which they eat the roots of the plantain in my grass-walks is 
very curious; with their upper mandible, which is much longer than their 
lower, they bore under the plant, and so eat the root off upwards, leaving 
the tuft of leaves untouched.&nbsp; In this respect they are serviceable, 
as they destroy a very troublesome weed; but they deface the walks in some 
<!-- page 99--><a name="page99"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
99</span>measure by digging little round holes.&nbsp; It appears, by the 
dung that they drop upon the turf, that beetles are no inconsiderable part 
of their food.&nbsp; In June last I procured a litter of four or five young
hedgehogs, which appeared to be about five or six days old: they, I find, 
like puppies, are born blind, and could not see when they came to my 
hands.&nbsp; No doubt their spines are soft and flexible at the time of 
their birth, or else the poor dam would have but a bad time of it in the 
critical moment of parturition, but it is plain they soon harden; for these
little pigs had such stiff prickles on their backs and sides as would 
easily have fetched blood, had they not been handled with caution.&nbsp; 
Their spines are quite white at this age; and they have little hanging 
ears, which I do not remember to be discernible in the old ones.&nbsp; They
can, in part, at this age draw their skin down over their faces, but are 
not able to contract themselves into a ball, as they do, for the sake of 
defence, when full grown.&nbsp; The reason, I suppose, is, because the 
curious muscle that enables the creature to roll itself up in a ball was 
not then arrived at its full tone and firmness.&nbsp; Hedgehogs make a deep
and warm <i>hybernaculum</i> with leaves and moss, in which they conceal 
themselves for the winter: but I never could find that they stored in any 
winter provision, as some quadrupeds certainly do.</p>
<p>I have discovered an anecdote with respect to the <!-- page 100--><a 
name="page100"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 100</span>fieldfare (<i>turdus 
pilaris</i>) which I think is particular enough; this bird, though it sits 
on trees in the daytime, and procures the greatest part of its food from 
white-thorn hedges, yea, moreover, builds on very high trees, as may be 
seen by the <i>fauna suecica</i>; yet always appears with us to roost on 
the ground.&nbsp; They are seen to come in flocks just before it is dark, 
and to settle and nestle among the heath on our forest.&nbsp; And besides, 
the larkers, in dragging their nets by night, frequently catch them in the 
wheat stubbles; while the bat-fowlers, who take many red-wings in the 
hedges, never entangle any of this species.&nbsp; Why these birds, in the 
matter of roosting, should differ from all their congeners, and from 
themselves also with respect to their proceedings by day, is a fact for 
which I am by no means able to account.</p>
<p>I have somewhat to inform you of concerning the <i>moose-deer</i>; but 
in general foreign animals fall seldom in my way; my little intelligence is
confined to the narrow sphere of my own observations at home.</p>

101</span>LETTER XXVIII.</h3>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">Selborne</span>, 
<i>March</i>, 1770.</p>
<p>On Michaelmas Day, 1768, I managed to get a sight of the female moose 
belonging to the Duke of Richmond, at Goodwood; but was greatly 
disappointed, when I arrived at the spot, to find that it died, after 
having appeared in a languishing way for some time, on the morning 
before.&nbsp; However, understanding that it was not stripped, I proceeded 
to examine this rare quadruped; I found it in an old greenhouse, slung 
under the belly and chin by ropes, and in a standing posture; but, though 
it had been dead for so short a time, it was in so putrid a state that the 
stench was hardly supportable.&nbsp; The grand distinction between this 
deer, and any other species that I have ever met with, consisted in the 
strange length of its legs, on which it was tilted up much in the manner of
the birds of the <i>grall&oelig;</i> order.&nbsp; I measured it, as they do
a horse, and found that, from the ground to the withers, it was just five 
feet four inches, which height answers exactly to sixteen hands, a growth 
that few horses arrive at: but then, with this length of legs, its neck was
remarkably short, no more than twelve inches; so that, by straddling with 
one foot forward and the other backward, it grazed on the plain ground, 
with <!-- page 102--><a name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
102</span>the greatest difficulty, between its legs; the ears were vast and
lopping, and as long as the neck; the head was about twenty inches long, 
and ass-like, and had such a redundancy of upper lip as I never saw before,
with huge nostrils.&nbsp; This lip, travellers say, is esteemed a dainty 
dish in North America.&nbsp; It is very reasonable to suppose that this 
creature supports itself chiefly by browsing of trees, and by wading after 
water plants; towards which way of livelihood the length of legs and great 
lip must contribute much.&nbsp; I have read somewhere that it delights in 
eating the <i>nymph&oelig;a</i>, or water-lily.&nbsp; From the fore-feet to
the belly behind the shoulder it measured three feet and eight inches: the 
length of the legs before and behind consisted a great deal in the 
<i>tibia</i>, which was strangely long; but in my haste to get out of the 
stench, I forgot to measure that joint exactly.&nbsp; Its scut seemed to be
about an inch long; the colour was a grizzly black; the mane about four 
inches long; the fore-hoofs were upright and shapely, the hind flat and 
splayed.&nbsp; The spring before it was only two years old, so that most 
probably it was not then come to its growth.&nbsp; What a vast, tall beast 
must a full-grown stag be!&nbsp; I have been told some arrive at ten feet 
and a half!&nbsp; This poor creature had at first a female companion of the
same species, which died the spring before.&nbsp; In the same garden was a 
young stag, or red deer, between whom and this moose <!-- page 103--><a 
name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 103</span>it was hoped that 
there might have been a breed; but their inequality of height must have 
always been a bar to any commerce of the amorous kind.&nbsp; I should have 
been glad to have examined the teeth, tongue, lips, hoofs, etc., minutely, 
but the putrefaction precluded all farther curiosity.&nbsp; This animal, 
the keeper told me, seemed to enjoy itself best in the extreme frost of the
former winter.&nbsp; In the house they showed me the horn of a male moose, 
which had no front antlers, but only a broad palm with some snags on the 
edge.&nbsp; The noble owner of the dead moose proposed to make a skeleton 
of her bones.</p>
<p>Please to let me hear if my female moose corresponds with that you saw, 
and whether you think still that the American moose and European elk are 
the same creature.</p>

<h3>LETTER XXIX.</h3>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">Selborne</span>, <i>May 
12th</i>, 1770.</p>
<p>Dear Sir,&mdash;Last month we had such a series of cold, turbulent 
weather, such a constant succession of frost, and snow, and hail, and 
tempest, that the regular <!-- page 104--><a name="page104"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 104</span>migration or appearance of the summer birds 
was much interrupted.&nbsp; Some did not show themselves (at least were not
heard) till weeks after their usual time, as the blackcap and whitethroat; 
and some have not been heard yet, as the grasshopper-lark and largest 
willow-wren.&nbsp; As to the fly-catcher, I have not seen it; it is indeed 
one of the latest, but should appear about this time: and yet, amidst all 
this meteorous strife and war of the elements, two swallows discovered 
themselves, as long ago as April 11th, in frost and snow; but they withdrew
quickly, and were not visible again for many days.&nbsp; House-martins, 
which are always more backward than swallows, were not observed till May 
came in.</p>
<p>Among the monogamous birds several are to be found, after pairing-time, 
single, and of each sex; but whether this state of celibacy is matter of 
choice or necessity, is not so easy discoverable.&nbsp; When the 
house-sparrows deprive my martins of their nests, as soon as I cause one to
be shot, the other, be it cock or hen, presently procures a mate, and so 
for several times following.</p>
<p>I have known a dove-house infested by a pair of white owls which made 
great havoc among the young pigeons: one of the owls was shot as soon as 
possible, but the survivor readily found a mate, and the mischief went 
on.&nbsp; After some time the <!-- page 105--><a name="page105"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 105</span>new pair were both destroyed, and the 
annoyance ceased.</p>
<p>Another instance I remember of a sportsman, whose zeal for the increase 
of his game being greater than his humanity, after pairing-time he always 
shot the cock-bird of every couple of partridges upon his grounds; 
supposing that the rivalry of many males interrupted the breed: he used to 
say, that, though he had widowed the same hen several times, yet he found 
she was still provided with a fresh paramour, that did not take her away 
from her usual haunt.</p>
<p>Again; I knew a lover of setting, an old sportsman, who has often told 
me that soon after harvest he has frequently taken small coveys of 
partridges, consisting of cock-birds alone; these he pleasantly used to 
call old bachelors.</p>
<p>There is a propensity belonging to common house-cats that is very 
remarkable; I mean their violent fondness for fish, which appears to be 
their most favourite food: and yet nature in this instance seems to have 
planted in them an appetite that, unassisted, they know not how to gratify;
for of all quadrupeds cats are the least disposed towards water, and will 
not, when they can avoid it, deign to wet a foot, much less to plunge into 
that element.</p>
<p>Quadrupeds that prey on fish are amphibious: such is the otter, which by
nature is so well formed for <!-- page 106--><a name="page106"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 106</span>diving, that it makes great havoc among the 
inhabitants of the waters.&nbsp; Not supposing that we had any of those 
beasts in our shallow brooks, I was much pleased to see a male otter, 
brought to me, weighing twenty-one pounds, that had been shot on the bank 
of our stream below the Priory, where the rivulet divides the parish of 
Selborne from Harteley Wood.</p>
<h3>LETTER XXX.</h3>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">Selborne</span>, <i>Aug. 
1st</i>, 1770.</p>
<p>Dear Sir,&mdash;The French, I think, in general are strangely prolix in 
their natural history.&nbsp; What Linn&aelig;us says with respect to 
insects holds good in every other branch: &ldquo;<i>Verbositas 
pr&aelig;sentis s&aelig;culi</i>, <i>calamitas artis</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pray how do you approve of Scopoli&rsquo;s new work?&nbsp; As I admire 
his &ldquo;Entomologia,&rdquo; I long to see it.</p>
<p>I forgot to mention in my last letter (and had not room to insert in the
former) that the male moose, in rutting time, swims from island to island, 
in the lakes and rivers of North America, in pursuit of the females.&nbsp; 
My friend, the chaplain, saw one killed in the water as it was on that 
errand in the river St. <!-- page 107--><a name="page107"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 107</span>Lawrence: it was a monstrous beast, he told 
me; but he did not take the dimensions.</p>
<p>When I was last in town, our friend Mr. Barrington most obligingly 
carried me to see many curious sights.&nbsp; As you were then writing to 
him about horns, he carried me to see many strange and wonderful 
specimens.&nbsp; There is, I remember, at Lord Pembroke&rsquo;s at Wilton, 
a horn room furnished with more than thirty different pairs; but I have not
seen that house lately.</p>
<p>Mr. Barrington showed me many astonishing collections of stuffed and 
living birds from all quarters of the world.&nbsp; After I had studied over
the latter for a time, I remarked that every species almost that came from 
distant regions, such as South America, the coast of Guinea, etc., were 
thick-billed birds of the <i>loxia</i> and <i>fringilla</i> genera; and no 
<i>motacill&aelig;</i>, or <i>muscicap&aelig;</i>, were to be met 
with.&nbsp; When I came to consider, the reason was obvious enough, for the
hard-billed birds subsist on seeds which are easily carried on board, while
the soft-billed birds, which are supported by worms and insects, or, what 
is a <i>succedaneum</i> for them, fresh raw meat, can meet with neither in 
long and tedious voyages.&nbsp; It is from this defect of food that our 
collections (curious as they are) are defective, and we are deprived of 
some of the most delicate and lively genera.</p>

<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">Selborne</span>, <i>Sept. 
14th</i>, 1770.</p>
<p>Dear Sir,&mdash;You saw, I find, the ring-ousels again among their 
native crags, and are farther assured that they continue resident in those 
cold regions the whole year.&nbsp; From whence then do our ring-ousels 
migrate so regularly every September, and make their appearance again, as 
if in their return, every April?&nbsp; They are more early this year than 
common, for some were seen at the usual hill on the fourth of this 
month.</p>
<p>An observing Devonshire gentleman tells me that they frequent some parts
of Dartmoor, and breed there, but leave those haunts about the end of 
September, or beginning of October, and return again about the end of 
March.</p>
<p>Another intelligent person assures me that they breed in great abundance
all over the peak of Derby, and are called there tor-ousels, withdraw in 
October and November, and return in spring.&nbsp; This information seems to
throw some light on my new migration.</p>
<p>Scopoli&rsquo;s new work (which I have just procured) has its merit in 
ascertaining many of the birds of the Tirol and Carniola.&nbsp; 
Monographers, come from whence they may, have, I think, fair pretence to 
challenge some regard and approbation from the lovers of <!-- page 109--><a
name="page109"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 109</span>natural history; for,
as no man can alone investigate the works of nature, these partial writers 
may, each in their department, be more accurate in their discoveries, and 
freer from errors, than more general writers; and so by degrees may pave 
the way to an universal correct natural history.&nbsp; Not that Scopoli is 
so circumstantial and attentive to the life and conversation of his birds 
as I could wish: he advances some false facts; as when he says of the 
<i>hirundo urbica</i> that &ldquo;<i>pullos extra nidum non 
nutrit</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; This assertion I know to be wrong from repeated 
observation this summer; for house-martins do feed their young flying, 
though it must be acknowledged not so commonly as the house-swallow; and 
the feat is done in so quick a manner as not to be perceptible to 
indifferent observers.&nbsp; He also advances some (I was going to say) 
improbable facts; as when he says of the woodcock that &ldquo;<i>pullos 
rostro portat fugiens ab hoste</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; But candour forbids me to 
say absolutely that any fact is false, because I have never been witness to
such a fact.&nbsp; I have only to remark that the long unwieldy bill of the
woodcock is perhaps the worst adapted of any among the winged creation for 
such a feat of natural affection.</p>

<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">Selborne</span>, 
<i>October 29th</i>, 1770.</p>
<p>Dear Sir,&mdash;After an ineffectual search in Linn&aelig;us, Brisson, 
etc., I begin to suspect that I discern my brother&rsquo;s <i>hirundo 
hyberna</i> in Scopoli&rsquo;s new discovered <i>hirundo rupestris</i>, p. 
167.&nbsp; His description of &ldquo;<i>Supra murina</i>, <i>subtus 
albida</i>; <i>rectrices macul&acirc; ovali alb&acirc; in latere 
interno</i>; <i>pedes nudi</i>, <i>nigri</i>; <i>rostrum nigrum</i>; 
<i>remiges obscuriores quam plum&aelig; dorsales</i>; <i>rectrices 
remigibus concolores</i>; <i>caud&acirc; emarginat&acirc;</i>, <i>nec 
forcipat&acirc;</i>,&rdquo; agrees very well with the bird in question: but
when he comes to advance that it is &ldquo;<i>statura hirundinis 
urbic&aelig;</i>,&rdquo; and that &ldquo;<i>definitio hirundinis 
ripari&aelig; Linn&aelig;i huic quoque conven&iuml;it</i>,&rdquo; he in 
some measure invalidates all he has said; at least, he shows at once that 
he compares them to these species merely from memory: for I have compared 
the birds themselves, and find they differ widely in every circumstance of 
shape, size, and colour.&nbsp; However, as you will have a specimen, I 
shall be glad to hear what your judgment is in the matter.</p>
<p>Whether my brother is forestalled in his nondescript or not, he will 
have the credit of first discovering that they spend their winters under 
the warm and sheltry shores of Gibraltar and Barbary.</p>
<p><!-- page 111--><a name="page111"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
111</span>Scopoli&rsquo;s characters of his ordines and genera are clear, 
just, and expressive, and much in the spirit of Linn&aelig;us.&nbsp; These 
few remarks are the result of my first perusal of Scopoli&rsquo;s 
&ldquo;Annus Primus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bane of our science is the comparing one animal to the other by 
memory; for want of caution in this particular Scopoli falls into errors; 
he is not so full with regard to the manners of his indigenous birds as 
might be wished, as you justly observe; his Latin is easy, elegant, and 
expressive, and very superior to Kramer&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>I am pleased to see that my description of the moose corresponds so well
with yours.</p>

<h3>LETTER XXXIII.</h3>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">Selborne</span>, <i>Nov. 
26th</i>, 1770.</p>
<p>Dear Sir,&mdash;I was much pleased to see, among the collection of birds
from Gibraltar, some of those short-winged English summer birds of passage,
concerning whose departure we have made so much inquiry.&nbsp; Now if these
birds are found in Andalusia to migrate to and from Barbary, it may easily 
be supposed that those that come to us may migrate back to the <!-- page 
112--><a name="page112"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 112</span>continent, 
and spend their winters in some of the warmer parts of Europe.&nbsp; This 
is certain, that many soft-billed birds that come to Gibraltar appear there
only in spring and autumn, seeming to advance in pairs towards the 
northward for the sake of breeding during the summer months, and retiring 
in parties and broods towards the south at the decline of the year; so that
the rock of Gibraltar is the great rendezvous and place of observation, 
from whence they take their departure each way towards Europe or 
Africa.&nbsp; It is therefore no mean discovery, I think, to find that our 
small short-winged summer birds of passage are to be seen spring and autumn
on the very skirts of Europe; it is presumptive proof of their 
emigrations.</p>
<p>Scopoli seems to me to have found the <i>hirundo melba</i>, the great 
Gibraltar swift, in Tirol, without knowing it.&nbsp; For what is his 
<i>hirundo alpina</i> but the afore-mentioned bird in other words?&nbsp; 
Says he, &ldquo;<i>Omnia prioris</i>&rdquo; (meaning the swift); 
&ldquo;<i>sed pectus album</i>; <i>paulo major priore</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; I 
do not suppose this to be a new species.&nbsp; It is true also of the 
<i>melba</i>, that &ldquo;<i>nidificat in excelsis Alpium 
rupibus</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; <i>Vid. Annum Primum</i>.</p>
<p>My Sussex friend, a man of observation and good sense, but no 
naturalist, to whom I applied on account of the stone-curlew, 
<i>&oelig;dicnemus</i>, sends me the following <!-- page 113--><a 
name="page113"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 113</span>account: &ldquo;In 
looking over my Naturalist&rsquo;s Journal for the month of April, I find 
the stone-curlews are first mentioned on the seventeenth and eighteenth, 
which date seems to me rather late.&nbsp; They live with us all the spring 
and summer, and at the beginning of autumn prepare to take leave by getting
together in flocks.&nbsp; They seem to me a bird of passage that may travel
into some dry, hilly country south of us, probably Spain, because of the 
abundance of sheep-walks in that country; for they spend their summers with
us in such districts.&nbsp; This conjecture I hazard, as I have never met 
with any one that has seen them in England in the winter.&nbsp; I believe 
they are not fond of going near the water, but feed on earth-worms, that 
are common on sheep-walks and downs.&nbsp; They breed on fallows and 
lay-fields abounding with grey mossy flints, which much resemble their 
young in colour, among which they skulk and conceal themselves.&nbsp; They 
make no nest, but lay their eggs on the bare ground, producing in common 
but two at a time.&nbsp; There is reason to think their young run soon 
after they are hatched, and that the old ones do not feed them, but only 
lead them about at the time of feeding, which, for the most part, is in the
night.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thus far, my friend.</p>
<p>In the manners of this bird you see there is something very analogous to
the bustard whom it also <!-- page 114--><a name="page114"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 114</span>somewhat resembles in aspect and make, and in 
the structure of its feet.</p>
<p>For a long time I have desired my relation to look out for these birds 
in Andalusia, and now he writes me word that, for the first time, he saw 
one dead in the market on the 3rd September.</p>
<p>When the <i>&oelig;dicnemus</i> flies it stretches out its legs straight
behind, like a heron.</p>

<h3>LETTER XXXIV.</h3>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">Selborne</span>, <i>March 
30th</i>, 1771.</p>
<p>Dear Sir,&mdash;There is an insect with us, especially on chalky 
districts, which is very troublesome and teasing all the latter end of the 
summer, getting into people&rsquo;s skins, especially those of women and 
children, and raising tumours which itch intolerably.&nbsp; This animal 
(which we call a harvest bug) is very minute, scarce discernible to the 
naked eye, of a bright scarlet colour, and of the genus of Acarus.&nbsp; 
They are to be met with in gardens on kidney-beans, or any legumens, but 
prevail only in the hot months of summer.&nbsp; Warreners, as some have 
assured me, are much infested by them on chalky downs, where these insects 
swarm sometimes <!-- page 115--><a name="page115"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 115</span>to so infinite a degree as to discolour their 
nets, and to give them a reddish cast, while the men are so bitten as to be
thrown into fevers.</p>
<p>There is a small, long, shining fly in these parts very troublesome to 
the housewife, by getting into the chimneys, and laying its eggs in the 
bacon while it is drying; these eggs produce maggots called jumpers, which,
harbouring in the gammons and best parts of the hogs, eat down to the bone,
and make great waste.&nbsp; This fly I suspect to be a variety of the 
<i>musca putris</i> of Linn&aelig;us; it is to be seen in the summer in 
farm-kitchens on the bacon-racks and about the mantel-pieces, and on the 
ceilings.</p>
<p>The insect that infests turnips and many crops in the garden (destroying
often whole fields while in their seedling leaves) is an animal that wants 
to be better known.&nbsp; The country people here call it the turnip-fly 
and black-dolphin; but I know it to be one of the <i>coleoptera</i>; the 
&ldquo;<i>chrysomela oleracea</i>, <i>saltatoria</i>, <i>femoribus posticis
crassissimis</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; In very hot summers they abound to an 
amazing degree, and, as you walk in a field or in a garden, make a 
pattering like rain, by jumping on the leaves of the turnips or 
cabbages.</p>
<p>There is an oestrus, known in these parts to every ploughboy, which, 
because it is omitted by Linn&aelig;us, is also passed over by late 
writers; and that is the <i>curvicauda</i> of old Mouset, mentioned by 
Derham in his <!-- page 116--><a name="page116"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 116</span>&rdquo;Physico-Theology,&rdquo; p. 250; an 
insect worthy of remark for depositing its eggs as it flies in so dextrous 
manner on the single hairs of the legs and flanks of grass-horses.&nbsp; 
But then Derham is mistaken when he advances that this oestrus is the 
parent of that <!-- page 117--><a name="page117"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 117</span>wonderful star-tailed maggot which he mentions
afterwards; for more modern entomologists have discovered that singular 
production to be derived from the egg, or the <i>musca cham&aelig;leon</i>;
see Geoffroy, t. xvii.&nbsp; f. 4.</p>
<p>A full history of noxious insects hurtful in the field, garden, and 
house, suggesting all the known and likely means of destroying them, would 
be allowed by the public to be a most useful and important work.&nbsp; What
knowledge there is of this sort lies scattered, and wants to be collected; 
great improvements would soon follow, of course.&nbsp; A knowledge of the 
properties, economy, propagation, and, in short, of the life and 
conversation of these animals, is a necessary step to lead us to some 
method of preventing their depredations.</p>
<p>As far as I am a judge, nothing would recommend entomology more than 
some neat plates that should well express the generic distinctions of 
insects according to Linn&aelig;us; for I am well assured that many people 
would study insects, could they set out with a more adequate notion of 
those distinctions than can be conveyed at first by words alone.</p>

<p>Dear Sir,&mdash;Happening to make a visit to my neighbour&rsquo;s 
peacocks, I could not help observing that the trains of those magnificent 
birds appear by no means to be their tails, those long feathers growing not
from their <i>uropygium</i>, but all up their backs.&nbsp; A range of short
brown stiff feathers, about six inches long, fixed in the <i>uropygium</i>,
is the real tail, and serves as the fulcrum to prop the train, which is 
long and top-heavy, when set on end.&nbsp; When the train is up, nothing 
appears of the bird before but its head and neck; but this would not be the
case were those long feathers fixed only in the rump, as may be seen by the
turkey cock when in a strutting attitude.&nbsp; By a strong muscular 
vibration these birds can make the shafts of their long feathers clatter 
like the swords of a sword-dancer; they then trample very quick with their 
feet, and run backwards towards the females.</p>
<p>I should tell you that I have got an uncommon <i>calculus 
&aelig;gogropila</i>, taken out of the stomach of a fat ox; it is perfectly
round, and about the size of a large Seville orange; such are, I think, 
usually flat.</p>

<p>Dear Sir,&mdash;The summer through I have seen but two of that large 
species of bat which I call <i>vespertilio altivolans</i>, from its manner 
of feeding high in the air; I procured one of them, and found it to be a 
male, and made no doubt, as they accompanied together, that the other was a
female; but, happening in an evening or two to procure the other likewise, 
I was somewhat disappointed, when it appeared to be also of the same 
sex.&nbsp; This circumstance, and the great scarcity of this sort, at least
in these parts, occasions some suspicions in my mind whether it is really a
species, or whether it may not be the male part of the more known species, 
one of which may supply many females, as is known to be the case in sheep 
and some other quadrupeds.&nbsp; But this doubt can only be cleared by a 
farther examination, and some attention to the sex, of more specimens: all 
that I know at present is, that my two were amply furnished with the parts 
of generation, much resembling those of a boar.</p>
<p>In the extent of their wings they measured fourteen inches and a half, 
and four inches and a half from the nose to the tip of the tail; their 
heads were large, their nostrils bilobated, their shoulders broad and 
muscular, <!-- page 120--><a name="page120"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
120</span>and their whole bodies fleshy and plump.&nbsp; Nothing could be 
more sleek and soft than their fur, which was of a bright chestnut colour; 
their maws were full of food, but so macerated that the quality could not 
be distinguished; their livers, kidneys, and hearts were large, and their 
bowels covered with fat.&nbsp; They weighed each, when entire, full one 
ounce and one drachm.&nbsp; Within the ear there was somewhat of a peculiar
structure that I did not understand perfectly! but refer it to the 
observation of the curious anatomist.&nbsp; These creatures sent forth a 
very rancid and offensive smell.</p>
<h3>LETTER XXXVII.</h3>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">Selborne</span>, 1771.</p>
<p>Dear Sir,&mdash;On the 12th July I had a fair opportunity of 
contemplating the motions of the <i>caprimulgus</i>, or fern-owl, as it was
playing round a large oak that swarmed with <i>scarab&aelig;i 
solstitiales</i>, or fern-chafers.&nbsp; The powers of its wing were 
wonderful, exceeding, if possible, the various evolutions and quick turns 
of the swallow genus.&nbsp; But the circumstance that pleased me most was, 
that I saw it distinctly, more than once, put out its short leg while on 
the wing, and, by a bend of the head, deliver somewhat into its 
mouth.&nbsp; If it takes <!-- page 121--><a name="page121"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 121</span>any part of its prey with its foot, as I have 
now the greatest reason to suppose it does these chafers, I no longer 
wonder at the use of its middle toe, which is curiously furnished with a 
serrated claw.</p>
<p>Swallows and martins, the bulk of them I mean, have forsaken us sooner 
this year than usual; for on September 22nd they rendezvoused in a 
neighbour&rsquo;s walnut-tree, where it seemed probable they had taken up 
their lodging for the night.&nbsp; At the dawn of the day, which was foggy,
they arose all together in infinite numbers, occasioning such a rushing 
from the strokes of their wings against the hazy air, as might be heard to 
a considerable distance: since that no flock has appeared, only a few 
stragglers.</p>
<p>Some swifts stayed late, till the 22nd August&mdash;a rare instance! for
they usually withdraw within the first week.</p>
<p>On September 24th three or four ring-ousels appeared in my fields for 
the first time this season; how punctual are these visitors in their 
autumnal and spring migrations!</p>

122</span>LETTER XXXVIII.</h3>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">Selborne</span>, <i>March 
15th</i>, 1773.</p>
<p>Dear Sir,&mdash;By my journal for last autumn it appears that the 
house-martins bred very late, and stayed very late in these parts; for, on 
the 1st October, I saw young martins in their nest nearly fledged; and 
again, on the 21st October, we had at the next house a nest full of young 
martins just ready to fly; and the old ones were hawking for insects with 
great alertness.&nbsp; The next morning the brood forsook their nest, and 
were flying round the village.&nbsp; From this day I never saw one of the 
swallow kind till November 3rd, when twenty, or perhaps thirty, 
house-martins were playing all day long by the side of the hanging wood, 
and over my field.&nbsp; Did these small weak birds, some of which were 
nestling twelve days ago, shift their quarters at this late season of the 
year to the other side of the northern tropic?&nbsp; Or rather, is it not 
more probable that the next church, ruin, chalk-cliff, steep covert, or 
perhaps sandbank, lake, or pool (as a more northern naturalist would say), 
may become their <i>hybernaculum</i>, and afford them a ready and obvious 
retreat?</p>
<p>We now begin to expect our vernal migration of ring-ousels every 
week.&nbsp; Persons worthy of credit assure me that ring-ousels were seen 
at Christmas, <!-- page 123--><a name="page123"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 123</span>1770, in the forest of Bere, on the southern 
verge of this county.&nbsp; Hence we may conclude that their migrations are
only internal, and not extending to the continent southward, if they do at 
first come at all from the northern parts of this island only, and not from
the north of Europe.&nbsp; Come from whence they will, it is plain, from 
the fearless disregard that they show for men or guns, that they have been 
little accustomed to places of much resort.&nbsp; Navigators mention that 
in the Isle of Ascension, and other such desolate districts, birds are so 
little acquainted with the human form that they settle on men&rsquo;s 
shoulders, and have no more dread of a sailor than they would have of a 
goat that was grazing.&nbsp; A young man at Lewes, in Sussex, assured me 
that about seven years ago ring-ousels abounded so about that town in the 
autumn that he killed sixteen himself in one afternoon; he added further, 
that some had appeared since in every autumn, but he could not find that 
any had been observed before the season in which he shot so many.&nbsp; I 
myself have found these birds in little parties in the autumn cantoned all 
along the Sussex downs, wherever there were shrubs and bushes, from 
Chichester to Lewes, particularly in the autumn of 1770.</p>

124</span>LETTER XXXIX.</h3>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">Selborne</span>, <i>Nov. 
9th</i>, 1773.</p>
<p>Dear Sir,&mdash;As you desire me to send you such observations as may 
occur, I take the liberty of making the following remarks, that you may, 
according as you think me right or wrong, admit or reject what I here 
advance, in your intended new edition of the &ldquo;British 
Zoology.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The osprey was shot about a year ago at Frinsham Pond, a great lake, at 
about six miles from hence, while it was sitting on the handle of a plough 
and devouring a fish: it used to precipitate itself into the water, and so 
take its prey by surprise.</p>
<p>A great ash-coloured butcher-bird was shot last winter in Tisted Park, 
and a red-backed butcher-bird [shrike] at Selborne: they are <i>rar&aelig; 
aves</i> in this county.</p>
<p>Crows go in pairs all the year round.</p>
<p>Cornish choughs abound, and breed on Beachy Head, and on all the cliffs 
of the Sussex coast.</p>
<p>The common wild pigeon, or stock-dove, is a bird of passage in the south
of England, seldom appearing till towards the end of November; is usually 
the latest winter-bird of passage.&nbsp; Before our beechen woods were so 
much destroyed we had myriads of them, <!-- page 125--><a 
name="page125"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 125</span>reaching in strings 
for a mile together as they went out in a morning to feed.&nbsp; They leave
us early in spring: where do they breed?</p>
<p>The people of Hampshire and Sussex call the missel-bird the storm-cock, 
because it sings early in the spring in blowing, showery weather; its song 
often commences with the year: with us it builds much in orchards.</p>
<p>A gentleman assures me he has taken the nests of ring-ousels on 
Dartmoor: they build in banks on the sides of streams.</p>
<p>Titlarks not only sing sweetly as they sit on trees, but also as they 
play and toy about on the wing, and particularly while they are descending,
and sometimes they stand on the ground.</p>
<p>Adanson&rsquo;s testimony seems to me to be a very poor evidence that 
European swallows migrate during our winter to Senegal: he does not talk at
all like an ornithologist; and probably saw only the swallows of that 
country, which I know build within Governor O&rsquo;Hara&rsquo;s hall 
against the roof.&nbsp; Had he known European swallows, would he not have 
mentioned the species?</p>
<p>The house-swallow washes by dropping into the water as it flies: this 
species appears commonly about a week before the house-martin, and about 
ten or twelve days before the swift.</p>
<p><!-- page 126--><a name="page126"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
126</span>In 1772 there were young house-martins in their nest till October
23rd.</p>
<p>The swift appears about ten or twelve days later than the house-swallow:
viz., about the 24th or 26th April.</p>
<p>Whin-chats and stone-chatters stay with us the whole year.</p>
<p>Some wheat-ears continue with us the winter through.</p>
<p>Wag-tails, all sorts, remain with us all the winter.&nbsp; Bullfinches, 
when fed on hempseed, often become wholly black.</p>
<p>We have vast flocks of female chaffinches all the winter, with hardly 
any males among them.</p>
<p>When you say that in breeding-time the cock snipes make a bleating 
noise, and I a drumming (perhaps I should rather have said a humming), I 
suspect we mean the same thing.&nbsp; However, while they are playing about
on the wing they certainly make a loud piping with their mouths: but 
whether that bleating or humming is ventriloquous, or proceeds from the 
motion of their wings, I cannot say; but this I know, that when this noise 
happens, the bird is always descending, and his wings are violently 
agitated.</p>
<p>Soon after the lapwings have done breeding they congregate, and, leaving
the moors and marshes, betake themselves to downs and sheep-walks.</p>
<p><!-- page 127--><a name="page127"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
127</span>Two years ago last spring the little auk was found alive and 
unhurt, but fluttering and unable to rise, in a lane a few miles from 
Alresford, where there is a great lake: it was kept awhile, but died.</p>
<p>I saw young teals taken alive in the ponds of Wolmer Forest in the 
beginning of July last, along with flappers, or young wild ducks.</p>
<p>Speaking of the swift, that page says &ldquo;its drink the dew;&rdquo; 
whereas it should be &ldquo;it drinks on the wing;&rdquo; for all the 
swallow kind sip their water as they sweep over the face of pools or 
rivers: like Virgil&rsquo;s bees, they drink flying; &ldquo;<i>flumina 
summa libant</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; In this method of drinking perhaps this 
genus may be peculiar.</p>
<p>Of the sedge-bird, be pleased to say it sings most part of the night; 
its notes are hurrying, but not unpleasing, and imitative of several birds;
as the sparrow, swallow, skylark.&nbsp; When it happens to be silent in the
night, by throwing a stone or clod into the bushes where it sits you 
immediately set it a-singing; or, in other words, though it slumbers 
sometimes, yet as soon as it is awakened it reassumes its song.</p>

128</span>LETTER XL.</h3>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">Selborne</span>, <i>Sept. 
2nd</i>, 1774.</p>
<p>Dear Sir,&mdash;Before your letter arrived, and of my own accord, I had 
been remarking and comparing the tails of the male and female swallow, and 
this ere any young broods appeared; so that there was no danger of 
confounding the dams with their <i>pulli</i>: and besides, as they were 
then always in pairs, and busied in the employ of nidification, there could
be no room for mistaking the sexes, nor the individuals of different 
chimneys the one for the other.&nbsp; From all my observations, it 
constantly appeared that each sex has the long feathers in its tail that 
give it that forked shape; with this difference, that they are longer in 
the tail of the male than in that of the female.</p>
<p>Nightingales, when their young first come abroad and are helpless, make 
a plaintive and a jarring noise, and also a snapping or cracking, pursuing 
people along the hedges as they walk; these last sounds seem intended for 
menace and defiance.</p>
<p>The grasshopper-lark chirps all night in the height of summer.</p>
<p>Swans turn white the second year, and breed the third.</p>
<p>Weasels prey on moles, as appears by their being sometimes caught in 
mole-traps.</p>
<p><!-- page 129--><a name="page129"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
129</span>Sparrow-hawks sometimes breed in old crows&rsquo; nests, and the 
kestril in churches and ruins.</p>
<p>There are supposed to be two sorts of eels in the island of Ely.&nbsp; 
The threads sometimes discovered in eels are perhaps their young: the 
generation of eels is very dark and mysterious.</p>
<p>Hen-harriers breed on the ground, and seem never to settle on trees.</p>
<p>When redstarts shake their tails they move them horizontally, as dogs do
when they fawn: the tail of a wagtail, when in motion, bobs up and down 
like that of a jaded horse.</p>
<p>Hedge-sparrows have a remarkable flirt with their wings in 
breeding-time; as soon as frosty mornings come they make a very piping, 
plaintive noise.</p>
<p>Many birds, which become silent about Midsummer, reassume their notes 
again in September, as the thrush, blackbird, woodlark, willow-wren, etc.; 
hence August is by much the most mute month, the spring, summer, and autumn
through.&nbsp; Are birds induced to sing again because the temperament of 
autumn resembles that of spring?</p>
<p>Linn&aelig;us ranges plants geographically; palms inhabit the tropics, 
grasses the temperate zones, and mosses and lichens the polar circles; no 
doubt animals may be classed in the same manner with propriety.</p>
<p>House-sparrows build under eaves in the spring; as <!-- page 130--><a 
name="page130"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 130</span>the weather becomes 
hotter, they get out for coolness, and nest in plum-trees and 
apple-trees.&nbsp; These birds have been known sometimes to build in 
rooks&rsquo; nests, and sometimes in the forks of boughs under rooks&rsquo;
nests.</p>
<p>As my neighbour was housing a rick, he observed that his dogs devoured 
all the little red mice that they could catch, but rejected the common 
mice; and that his cats ate the common mice, refusing the red.</p>
<p>Redbreasts sing all through the spring, summer, and autumn.&nbsp; The 
reason that they are called autumn songsters is, because in the two first 
seasons their voices are drowned and lost in the general chorus; in the 
latter their song becomes distinguishable.&nbsp; Many songsters of the 
autumn seem to be the young cock redbreasts of that year: nothwithstanding 
the prejudices in their favour, they do much mischief in gardens to the 
summer fruits.</p>
<p>The titmouse, which early in February begins to make two quaint notes, 
like the whetting of a saw, is the marsh titmouse; the great titmouse sings
with three cheerful, joyous notes, and begins about the same time.</p>
<p>Wrens sing all the winter through, frost excepted.&nbsp; House-martins 
came remarkably late this year both in Hampshire and Devonshire.&nbsp; Is 
this circumstance for or against either hiding or migration?</p>
<p><!-- page 131--><a name="page131"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
131</span>Most birds drink sipping at intervals; but pigeons take a long 
continued draught, like quadrupeds.&nbsp; Notwithstanding what I have said 
in a former letter, no grey crows were ever known to breed on Dartmoor; it 
was my mistake.</p>
<p>The appearance and flying of the <i>Scarab&oelig;us solstitialis</i>, or
fern-chafer, commence with the month of July, and cease about the end of 
it.&nbsp; These scarabs are the constant food of <i>Caprimulgi</i>, or 
fern-owls, through that period.&nbsp; They abound on the chalky downs and 
in some sandy districts, but not in the clays.</p>
<p>In the garden of the Black Bear inn in the town of Reading, is a stream 
or canal running under the stables and out into the fields on the other 
side of the road.&nbsp; In this water are many carps, which lie rolling 
about in sight, being fed by travellers, who amuse themselves by tossing 
them bread; but as soon as the weather grows at all severe these fishes are
no longer seen, because they retire under the stables, where they remain 
till the return of spring.&nbsp; Do they lie in a torpid state?&nbsp; If 
they do not, how are they supported?</p>
<p>The note of the whitethroat, which is continually repeated, and often 
attended with odd gesticulations on the wing, is harsh and 
displeasing.&nbsp; These birds seem of a pugnacious disposition, for they 
sing with an erected crest and attitudes of rivalry and defiance; are <!-- 
page 132--><a name="page132"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 132</span>shy and
wild in breeding-time, avoiding neighbourhoods, and haunting lonely lanes 
and commons; nay, even the very tops of the Sussex Downs, where there are 
bushes and covert, but in July and August they bring their broods into 
gardens and orchards, and make great havoc among the summer fruits.</p>
<p>The blackcap has in common a full, sweet, deep, loud, and wild pipe; yet
that strain is of short continuance, and his motions are desultory; but 
when that bird sits calmly and engages in song in earnest, he pours forth 
very sweet but inward melody, and expresses great variety of soft and 
gentle modulations, superior perhaps to those of any of our warblers, the 
nightingale excepted.</p>
<p>Blackcaps mostly haunt orchards and gardens; while they warble their 
throats are wonderfully distended.</p>
<p>The song of the redstart is superior, though somewhat like that of the 
whitethroat; some birds have a few more notes than others.&nbsp; Sitting 
very placidly on the top of a tall tree in a village, the cock sings from 
morning to night.&nbsp; He affects neighbourhoods, and avoids solitude, and
loves to build in orchards and about houses; with us he perches on the vane
of a tall maypole.</p>
<p>The fly-catcher is, of all our summer birds, the most mute and the most 
familiar; it also appears the last <!-- page 133--><a 
name="page133"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 133</span>of any.&nbsp; It 
builds in a vine, or a sweetbriar, against the wall of a house, or in the 
hole of a wall, or on the end of a beam or plate, and often close to the 
post of a door where people are going in and out all day long.&nbsp; This 
bird does not make the least pretension to song, but uses a little inward 
wailing note when it thinks its young in danger from cats or other 
annoyances; it breeds but once, and retires early.</p>
<p>Selborne parish alone can and has exhibited at times more than half the 
birds that are ever seen in all Sweden; the former has produced more than 
one hundred and twenty species, the latter only two hundred and 
twenty-one.&nbsp; Let me add, also, that it has shown near half the species
that were ever known in Great Britain.</p>
<p>On a retrospect, I observe that my long letter carries with it a quaint 
and magisterial air, and is very sententious; but when I recollect that you
requested stricture and anecdote, I hope you will pardon the didactic 
manner for the sake of the information it may happen to contain.</p>
<h3><!-- page 134--><a name="page134"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
134</span>LETTER XLI.</h3>
<p>It is matter of curious inquiry to trace out how those species of 
soft-billed birds that continue with us the winter through subsist during 
the dead months.&nbsp; The imbecility of birds seems not to be the only 
reason why they shun the rigour of our winters; for the robust wryneck (so 
much resembling the hardy race of woodpeckers) migrates, while the feeble 
little golden-crowned wren, that shadow of a bird, braves our severest 
frosts without availing himself of houses or villages, to which most of our
winter birds crowd in distressful seasons, while this keeps aloof in fields
and woods; but perhaps this may be the reason why they may often perish, 
and why they are almost as rare as any bird we know.</p>
<p>I have no reason to doubt but that the soft-billed birds, which winter 
with us, subsist chiefly on insects in their aurelia state.&nbsp; All the 
species of wagtails in severe weather haunt shallow streams near their 
spring-heads, where they never freeze, and, by wading, pick out the 
aurelias of the genus of <i>Phrygane&aelig;</i>, etc.</p>
<p>Hedge-sparrows frequent sinks and gutters in hard weather, where they 
pick up crumbs and other sweepings, and in mild weather they procure worms,
which are stirring every month in the year, as any one <!-- page 135--><a 
name="page135"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 135</span>may see that will 
only be at the trouble of taking a candle to a grass-plot on any mild 
winter&rsquo;s night.&nbsp; Redbreasts and wrens in the winter haunt 
outhouses, stables, and barns, where they find spiders and flies that have 
laid themselves up during the cold season.&nbsp; But the grand support of 
the soft-billed birds in winter is that infinite profusion of aurelia of 
the <i>Lepidoptera ordo</i>, which is fastened to the twigs of trees and 
their trunks, to the pales and walls of gardens and buildings, and is found
in every cranny and cleft of rock or rubbish, and even in the ground 
itself.</p>
<p>Every species of titmouse winters with us; they have what I call a kind 
of intermediate bill between the hard and the soft, between the 
Linn&aelig;an genera of <i>Fringilla</i> and <i>Motacilla</i>.&nbsp; One 
species alone spends its whole time in the woods and fields, never 
retreating for succour in the severest seasons to houses and 
neighbourhoods; and that is the delicate long-tailed titmouse, which is 
almost as minute as the golden-crowned wren; but the blue titmouse or nun 
(<i>Parus c&aelig;ruleus</i>), the cole-mouse (<i>Parus ater</i>), the 
great black-headed titmouse (<i>Fringillago</i>), and the marsh titmouse 
(<i>Parus palustris</i>), all resort at times to buildings, and in hard 
weather particularly.&nbsp; The great titmouse, driven by stress of 
weather, much frequents houses; and, in deep snows, I have seen this bird, 
while it hung with its back downwards (to my no <!-- page 136--><a 
name="page136"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 136</span>small delight and 
admiration), draw straws lengthwise from out the eaves of thatched houses, 
in order to pull out the flies that were concealed between them, and that 
in such numbers that they quite defaced the thatch, and gave it a ragged 
appearance.</p>
<p>The blue titmouse, or nun, is a great frequenter of houses, and a 
general devourer.&nbsp; Besides insects, it is very fond of flesh, for it 
frequently picks bones on dunghills: it is a vast admirer of suet, and 
haunts butchers&rsquo; shops.&nbsp; When a boy, I have known twenty in a 
morning caught with snap mouse-traps, baited with tallow or suet.&nbsp; It 
will also pick holes in apples left on the ground, and be well entertained 
with the seeds on the head of a sunflower.&nbsp; The blue, marsh, and great
titmice will, in very severe weather, carry away barley and oat-straws from
the sides of ricks.</p>
<p>How the wheatear and whinchat support themselves in winter cannot be so 
easily ascertained, since they spend their time on wild heaths and warrens;
the former especially, where there are stone quarries: most probably it is 
that their maintenance arises from the aureli&aelig; of the <i>Lepidoptera 
ordo</i>, which furnish them with a plentiful table in the wilderness.</p>

<p>Dear Sir,&mdash;Some future faunist, a man of fortune, will, I hope, 
extend his visits to the kingdom of Ireland; a new field and a country 
little known to the naturalist.&nbsp; He will not, it is to be wished, 
undertake that tour unaccompanied by a botanist, because the mountains have
scarcely been sufficiently examined; and the southerly counties of so mild 
an island may possibly afford some plants little to be expected within the 
British dominions.&nbsp; A person of a thinking turn of mind will draw many
just remarks from the modern improvements of that country, both in arts and
agriculture, where premiums obtained long before they were heard of with 
us.&nbsp; The manners of the wild natives, their superstitions, their 
prejudices, their sordid way of life, will extort from him many useful 
reflections.&nbsp; He should also take with him an able draughtsman, for he
must by no means pass over the noble castles and seats, the extensive and 
picturesque lakes and waterfalls, and the lofty stupendous mountains, so 
little known, and so engaging to the imagination when described and 
exhibited in a lively manner; such a work would be well received.</p>
<p>As I have seen no modern map of Scotland, I <!-- page 138--><a 
name="page138"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 138</span>cannot pretend to say
how accurate or particular any such may be; but this I know, that the best 
old maps of that kingdom are very defective.</p>
<p>The great obvious defect that I have remarked in all maps of Scotland 
that have fallen in my way is a want of a coloured line, or stroke, that 
shall exactly define the just limits of that district called the 
Highlands.&nbsp; Moreover, all the great avenues to that mountainous and 
romantic country want to be well distinguished.&nbsp; The military roads 
formed by General Wade are so great and Roman-like an undertaking that they
well merit attention.&nbsp; My old map, Moll&rsquo;s Map, takes notice of 
Fort William, but could not mention the other forts that have been erected 
long since; therefore a good representation of the chain of forts should 
not be omitted.</p>
<p>The celebrated zigzag up the Coryarich must not be passed over.&nbsp; 
Moll takes notice of Hamilton and Drumlanrig, and such capital houses; but 
a new survey, no doubt, should represent every seat and castle remarkable 
for any great event, or celebrated for its paintings, etc.&nbsp; Lord 
Breadalbane&rsquo;s seat and beautiful <i>policy</i> are too curious and 
extraordinary to be omitted.</p>
<p>The seat of the Earl of Eglingtoun, near Glasgow, is worthy of 
notice.&nbsp; The pine plantations of that nobleman are very grand and 
extensive indeed.</p>

<p>A pair of honey-buzzards, <i>Buteo opivorus</i>, <i>sive Vespivorus 
Raii</i>, built them a large shallow nest, composed of twigs and lined with
dead beechen leaves, upon a tall, slender beech near the middle of Selborne
Hanger, in the summer of 1780.&nbsp; In the middle of the month of June a 
bold boy climbed this tree though standing on so steep and dizzy a 
situation, and brought down an egg, the only one in the nest, which had 
been sat on for some time, and contained the embryo of a young bird.&nbsp; 
The egg was smaller, and not so round as those of the common buzzard; was 
dotted at each end with small red spots, and surrounded in the middle with 
a broad bloody zone.&nbsp; The hen bird was shot, and answered exactly to 
Mr. Ray&rsquo;s description of that species; had a black cere, short thick 
legs, and a long tail.&nbsp; When on the wing this species may be easily 
distinguished from the common buzzard by its hawk-like appearance, small 
head, wings not so blunt, and longer tail.&nbsp; This specimen contained in
its craw some limbs of frogs and many grey snails without shells.&nbsp; The
irides of the eyes of this bird were of a beautiful bright yellow 
colour.</p>
<p>About the 10th July in the same summer a pair of sparrow-hawks bred in 
an old crow&rsquo;s nest on a low <!-- page 140--><a 
name="page140"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 140</span>beech in the same 
hanger; and as their brood, which was numerous, began to grow up, became so
daring and ravenous, that they were a terror to all the dames in the 
village that had chickens or ducklings under their care.&nbsp; A boy 
climbed the tree, and found the young so fledged that they all escaped from
him, but discovered that a good house had been kept: the larder was 
well-stored with provisions, for he brought down a young blackbird, jay, 
and house-martin, all clean picked, and some half devoured.&nbsp; The old 
birds had been observed to make sad havoc for some days among the new-flown
swallows and martins, which, being but lately out of their nests, had not 
acquired those powers and command of wing that enable them, when more 
mature, to set such enemies at defiance.</p>
<h3>LETTER XLIV.</h3>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">Selborne</span>, <i>Nov. 
30th</i>, 1780.</p>
<p>Dear Sir,&mdash;Every incident that occasions a renewal of our 
correspondence will ever be pleasing and agreeable to me.</p>
<p>As to the wild wood-pigeon, the <i>&OElig;nas</i>, or <i>Vinago</i>, of 
Ray, I am much of your mind, and see no reason for making it the origin of 
the common house-dove: but <!-- page 140--><a name="page140"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 140</span>suppose those that have advanced that opinion 
may have been misled by another appellation, often given to the 
<i>&OElig;nas</i>, which is that of stock-dove.</p>
<p>Unless the stock-dove in the winter varies greatly in manners from 
itself in summer, no species seems more unlikely to be domesticated, and to
make a house-dove.&nbsp; We very rarely see the latter settle on trees at 
all, nor does it ever haunt the woods; but the former, as long as it stays 
with us, from November perhaps to February, lives the same wild life with 
the ring-dove, <i>Palumbus torquatus</i>; frequents coppices and groves, 
supports itself chiefly by mast, and delights to roost in the tallest 
beeches.&nbsp; Could it be known in what manner stock-doves build, the 
doubt would be settled with me at once, provided they construct their nests
on trees, like the ring-dove, as I much suspect they do.</p>
<p>You received, you say, last spring a stock-dove from Sussex, and are 
informed that they sometimes breed in that county.&nbsp; But why did not 
your correspondent determine the place of its nidification, whether on 
rocks, cliffs, or trees?&nbsp; If he was not an adroit ornithologist I 
should doubt the fact, because people with us perpetually confound the 
stock-dove with the ring-dove.</p>
<p>For my own part, I readily concur with you in supposing that house-doves
are derived from the small blue rock-pigeon, for many reasons.&nbsp; In the
first place the wild stock-dove is manifestly larger than the <!-- page 
141--><a name="page141"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 141</span>common 
house-dove, against the usual rule of domestication, which generally 
enlarges the breed.&nbsp; Again, those two remarkable black spots on the 
remiges of each wing of the stock-dove, which are so characteristic of the 
species, would not, one should think, be totally lost by its being 
reclaimed, but would often break out among its descendants.&nbsp; But what 
is worth a hundred arguments is, the instance you give in Sir Roger 
Mostyn&rsquo;s house-doves in C&aelig;rnarvonshire; which, though tempted 
by plenty of food and gentle treatment, can never be prevailed on to 
inhabit their cote for any time; but as soon as they begin to breed, betake
themselves to the fastnesses of Ormshead, and deposit their young in safety
amidst the inaccessible caverns and precipices of that stupendous 
promontory.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Naturam expellas furc&acirc; . . . tamen usque 
recurret.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have consulted a sportsman, now in his seventy-eighth year, who tells 
me that fifty or sixty years back, when the beechen woods were much more 
extensive than at present, the number of wood-pigeons was astonishing; that
he has often killed near twenty in a day, and that with a long wild-fowl 
piece he has shot seven or eight at a time on the wing as they came 
wheeling over his head: he moreover adds, which I was not aware of, that 
often there were among them little parties of small blue doves, which he 
calls <!-- page 142--><a name="page142"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
142</span>rockiers.&nbsp; The food of these numberless emigrants was 
beech-mast and some acorns, and particularly barley, which they collected 
in the stubbles.&nbsp; But of late years, since the vast increase of 
turnips, that vegetable has furnished a great part of their support in hard
weather; and the holes they pick in these roots greatly damage the 
crop.&nbsp; From this food their flesh has contracted a rancidness which 
occasions them to be rejected by nicer judges of eating, who thought them 
before a delicate dish.&nbsp; They were shot not only as they were feeding 
in the fields, and especially in snowy weather, but also at the close of 
the evening, by men who lay in ambush among the woods and groves to kill 
them as they came in to roost.&nbsp; These are the principal circumstances 
relating to this wonderful internal migration, which with us takes place 
towards the end of November, and ceases early in the spring.&nbsp; Last 
winter we had in Selborne high wood about a hundred of these doves; but in 
former times the flocks were so vast, not only with us but all the district
round, that on mornings and evenings they traversed the air, like rooks, in
strings, reaching for a mile together.&nbsp; When they thus rendezvoused 
here by thousands, if they happened to be suddenly roused from their 
roost-trees on an evening,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Their rising all at once was like the sound<br />
Of thunder heard remote.&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 144--><a name="page144"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
144</span>It will by no means be foreign to the present purpose to add, 
that I had a relation in this neighbourhood who made it a practice, for a 
time, whenever he could procure the eggs of a ring-dove, to place them 
under a pair of doves that were sitting in his own pigeon-house; hoping 
thereby, if he could bring about a coalition, to enlarge his breed, and 
teach his own doves to beat out into the woods, and to support themselves 
by mast; the plan was plausible, but something always interrupted the 
success; for though the birds were usually hatched, and sometimes grew to 
half their size, yet none ever arrived at maturity.&nbsp; I myself have 
seen these foundlings in their nest displaying a strange ferocity of 
nature, so as scarcely to bear to be looked at, and snapping with their 
bills by way of menace.&nbsp; In short, they always died, perhaps for want 
of proper sustenance: but the owner thought that by their fierce and wild 
demeanour they frighted their foster mothers, and so were starved.</p>
<p><!-- page 145--><a name="page145"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
145</span>Virgil, as a familiar occurrence, by way of simile, describes a 
dove haunting the cavern of a rock in such engaging numbers, that I cannot 
refrain from quoting the passage: and John Dryden has rendered it so 
happily in our language, that without further excuse I shall add his 
translation also.</p>
<blockquote>
<p> &ldquo;Qualis spelunc&acirc; subit&ograve; commota Columba,<br />
Cui domus, et dulces latebroso in pumice nidi,<br />
<!-- page 144--><a name="page144"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
144</span>Fertur in arva volans, plausumque exterrita pennis,<br />
Dat tecto ingentem&mdash;mox aere lapsa quieto,<br />
Radit iter liquidum, celeres neque commovet alas.&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;As when a dove her rocky hold forsakes,<br />
Rous&rsquo;d, in a fright her sounding wings she shakes;<br />
The cavern rings with clattering:&mdash;out she flies,<br />
And leaves her callow care, and cleaves the skies:<br />
At first she flutters:&mdash;but at length she springs<br />
To smoother flight, and shoots upon her wings.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I should now proceed to such birds as continue to sing after Midsummer, 
but, as they are rather numerous, they would exceed the bounds of this 
paper: besides, as this is now the season for remarking on that subject, I 
am willing to repeat my observations on some birds concerning the 
continuation of whose song I seem at present to have some doubt.</p>

birds strictly so called) as continue in full song till after Midsummer, 
and shall range them somewhat in the order in which they first begin to 
open as the spring advances.</p>

<p>All birds that continue in full song till after Midsummer appear to me

<p>Most kinds of birds seem to me to be wild and shy <!-- page 154--><a 
name="page154"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 154</span>somewhat in 
proportion to their bulk: I mean in this island, where they are much 
pursued and annoyed; but in Ascension Island, and many other desolate 
places, mariners have found fowls so unacquainted with a human figure, that
they would stand still to be taken, as is the case with boobies, etc.&nbsp;
As an example of what is advanced, I remark that the golden-crested wren 
(the smallest British bird) will stand unconcerned till you come within 
three or four yards of it, while the bustard (<i>Otis</i>), the largest 
British land fowl, does not care to admit a person within so many 
furlongs.</p>

<h3>LETTER III.</h3>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">Selborne</span>, <i>Jan. 
15th</i>, 1770.</p>
<p>Dear Sir,&mdash;It was no small matter of satisfaction to me to find 
that you were not displeased with my little <i>methodus</i> of birds.&nbsp;
If there was any merit in the sketch, it must be owing to its 
punctuality.&nbsp; For many months I carried a list in my pocket of the 
birds that were to be remarked, and, as I rode or walked about my business,
I noted each day the continuance or omission of each bird&rsquo;s song, so 
that I am as sure of the certainty of my facts as a man can be of any 
transaction whatsoever.</p>
<p><!-- page 155--><a name="page155"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
155</span>I shall now proceed to answer the several queries which you put 
in your two obliging letters, in the best manner that I am able.&nbsp; 
Perhaps Eastwick and its environs, where you heard so very few birds, is 
not a woodland country, and therefore not stocked with such 
songsters.&nbsp; If you will cast your eye on my last letter, you will find
that many species continued to warble after the beginning of July.</p>
<p>The titlark and yellow-hammer breed late, the latter very late; and 
therefore it is no wonder that they protract their song: for I lay it down 
as a maxim in ornithology, that as long as there is any incubation going on
there is music.&nbsp; As to the redbreast and wren, it is well known to the
most incurious observer that they whistle the year round, hard frost 
excepted&mdash;especially the latter.</p>
<p>It was not in my power to procure you a black-cap, or a less 
reed-sparrow, or sedge-bird, alive.&nbsp; As the first is undoubtedly, and 
the last, as far as I can yet see, a summer bird of passage, they would 
require more nice and curious management in a cage than I should be able to
give them: they are both distinguished songsters.&nbsp; The note of the 
former has such a wild sweetness that it always brings to my mind those 
lines in a song in &ldquo;As You Like It&rdquo;:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;And tune his merry note<br />
Unto the <i>wild</i> bird&rsquo;s throat.&rdquo;&mdash;<span 
class="smcap">Shakespeare</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 156--><a name="page156"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
156</span>The latter has a surprising variety of notes resembling the song 
of several other birds; but then it has also a hurrying manner, not at all 
to its advantage: it is notwithstanding a delicate polyglot.</p>
<p>It is new to me that titlarks in cages sing in the night; perhaps only 
caged birds do so.&nbsp; I once knew a tame redbreast in a cage that always
sang as long as candles were in the room; but in their wild state no one 
supposes they sing in the night.</p>
<p>I should be almost ready to doubt the fact that there are to be seen 
much fewer birds in July than in any former month, notwithstanding so many 
young are hatched daily.&nbsp; Sure I am that it is far otherwise with 
respect to the swallow tribe, which increases prodigiously as the summer 
advances: and I saw at the time mentioned many hundreds of young wagtails 
on the banks of the Cherwell, which almost covered the meadows.&nbsp; If 
the matter appears as you say in the other species, may it not be owing to 
the dams being engaged in incubation, while the young are concealed by the 
leaves.</p>
<p>Many times have I had the curiosity to open the stomachs of woodcocks 
and snipes: but nothing ever occurred that helped to explain to me what 
their subsistence might be: all that I could ever find was a soft mucus, 
among which lay many pellucid small gravels.</p>

157</span>LETTER IV.</h3>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">Selborne</span>, <i>Feb. 
19th</i>, 1770.</p>
<p>Dear Sir,&mdash;Your observation that &ldquo;the cuckoo does not deposit
its egg indiscriminately in the nest of the first bird that comes in its 
way, but probably looks out a nurse in some degree congenerous with whom to
intrust its young,&rdquo; is perfectly new to me, and struck me so forcibly
that I naturally fell into a train of thought that led me to consider 
whether the fact was so, and what reason there was for it.&nbsp; When I 
came to recollect and inquire, I could not find that any cuckoo had ever 
been seen in these parts, except in the nest of the wagtail, the 
hedge-sparrow, the titlark, the white-throat, and the redbreast, all 
soft-billed insectivorous birds.&nbsp; The excellent Mr. Willughby mentions
the nest of the <i>Palumbus</i> (ring-dove), and of the <i>Fringilla</i> 
(chaffinch), birds that subsist on acorns and grains, and such hard food: 
but then he does not mention them as of his own knowledge, but says 
afterwards that he saw himself a wagtail feeding a cuckoo.&nbsp; It appears
hardly possible that a soft-billed bird should subsist on the same food 
with the hard-billed: for the former have thin membranaceous stomachs 
suited to their soft food, while the latter, the granivorous tribe, <!-- 
page 158--><a name="page158"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 158</span>have 
strong muscular gizzards, which, like mills, grind, by the help of small 
gravels and pebbles, what is swallowed.&nbsp; This proceeding of the 
cuckoo, of dropping its eggs as it were by chance, is such a monstrous 
outrage on maternal affection, one of the first great dictates of nature, 
and such a violence on instinct, that, had it only been related of a bird 
in the Brazils, or Peru, it would never have merited our belief.&nbsp; But 
yet, should it further appear that this simple bird, when divested of that 
natural &sigma;&tau;&omicron;&rho;&gamma;&eta; that seems to raise the kind
in general above themselves, and inspire them with extraordinary degrees of
cunning and address, may be still endued with a more enlarged faculty of 
discerning what species are suitable and congenerous nursing-mothers for 
its disregarded eggs and young, and may deposit them only under their care,
this would be adding wonder to wonder, and instancing, in a fresh manner, 
that the methods of Providence are not subjected to any mode or rule, but 
astonish us in new lights, and in various and changeable appearances.</p>
<p>What was said by a very ancient and sublime writer concerning the defect
of natural affection in the ostrich may be well applied to the bird we are 
talking of:</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is hardened against her young ones, as though they were not 
hers:</p>
<p><!-- page 159--><a name="page159"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
159</span> &ldquo;Because God hath deprived her of wisdom, neither hath He 
imparted to her understanding.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Query</i>.&mdash;Does each female cuckoo lay but one egg in a season,
or does she drop several in different nests according as opportunity 
offers?</p>
<p style="text-align: right">I am, etc.</p>
<h3>LETTER V.</h3>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">Selborne</span>, <i>April 
12th</i>, 1770.</p>
<p>Dear Sir,&mdash;I heard many birds of several species sing last year 
after Midsummer, enough to prove that the summer solstice is not the period
that puts a stop to the music of the woods.&nbsp; The yellow-hammer no 
doubt persists with more steadiness than any other: but the woodlark, the 
wren, the redbreast, the swallow, the whitethroat, the goldfinch, the 
common linnet, are all undoubted instances of the truth of what I 
advanced.</p>
<p>If this severe season does not interrupt the regularity of the summer 
migrations, the black-cap will be here in two or three days.&nbsp; I wish 
it was in my power to procure you one of those songsters; but I am no 
bird-catcher, and so little used to birds in a cage, that I fear if I had 
one it would soon die for want of skill in feeding.</p>
<p><!-- page 160--><a name="page160"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
160</span>Was your reed-sparrow, which you kept in a cage, the thick-billed
reed-sparrow of the Zoology, p. 320; or was it the less reed-sparrow of 
Ray, the sedge-bird of Mr. Pennant&rsquo;s last publication, p. 16?</p>
<p>As to the matter of long-billed birds growing fatter in moderate frosts,
I have no doubt within myself what should be the reason.&nbsp; The thriving
at those times appears to me to arise altogether from the gentle check 
which the cold throws upon insensible perspiration.&nbsp; The case is just 
the same with blackbirds, etc.; and farmers and warreners observe, the 
first, that their hogs fat more kindly at such times, and the latter that 
their rabbits are never in such good case as in a gentle frost.&nbsp; But 
when frosts are severe, and of long continuance, the case is soon altered, 
for then a want of food soon overbalances the repletion occasioned by a 
checked perspiration.&nbsp; I have observed, moreover, that some human 
constitutions are more inclined to plumpness in winter than in summer.</p>
<p>When birds come to suffer by severe frost, I find that the first that 
fail and die are the redwing-fieldfares, and then the song-thrushes.</p>
<p>You wonder, with good reason, that the hedge-sparrows, etc., can be 
induced at all to sit on the egg of the cuckoo without being scandalised at
the vast disproportionate size of the supposititious egg; but the brute 
creation, I suppose, have very little idea of <!-- page 161--><a 
name="page161"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 161</span>size, colour, or 
number.&nbsp; For the common hen, I know, when the fury of incubation is on
her, will sit on a single shapeless stone instead of a nest full of eggs 
that have been withdrawn: and, moreover, a hen-turkey, in the same 
circumstances, would sit on in the empty nest till she perished with 
hunger.</p>
<p>I think the matter might easily be determined whether a cuckoo lays one 
or two eggs, or more, in a season, by opening a female during the 
laying-time.&nbsp; If more than one was come down out of the ovary and 
advanced to a good size, doubtless then she would that spring lay more than
one.</p>
<p>I will endeavour to get a hen, and to examine.</p>
<p>Your supposition that there may be some natural obstruction in singing 
birds while they are mute, and that when this is removed the song 
recommences, is new and bold: I wish you could discover some good grounds 
for this suspicion.</p>
<p>I was glad you were pleased with my specimen of the caprimulgus, or 
fern-owl; you were, I find, acquainted with the bird before.</p>
<p>When we meet I shall be glad to have some conversation with you 
concerning the proposal you make of my drawing up an account of the animals
in this neighbourhood.&nbsp; Your partiality towards my small abilities 
persuades you, I fear, that I am able to do more than is in my power: for 
it is no small <!-- page 162--><a name="page162"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 162</span>undertaking for a man unsupported and alone to
begin a natural history from his own autopsia!&nbsp; Though there is 
endless room for observation in the field of nature, which is boundless, 
yet investigation (where a man endeavours to be sure of his facts) can make
but slow progress; and all that one could collect in many years would go 
into a very narrow compass.</p>
<p>Some extracts from your ingenious &ldquo;Investigations of the 
Difference between the Present Temperature of the Air in Italy,&rdquo; 
etc., have fallen in my way, and gave me great satisfaction: they have 
removed the objections that always arose in my mind whenever I came to the 
passages which you quote.&nbsp; Surely the judicious Virgil, when writing a
didactic poem for the region of Italy, could never think of describing 
freezing rivers, unless such severity of weather pretty frequently 
occurred!</p>

<h3>LETTER VI.</h3>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">Selborne</span>, <i>May 
21st</i>, 1770.</p>
<p>Dear Sir,&mdash;The severity and turbulence of last month so interrupted
the regular process of summer migration, that some of the birds do but just
begin to <!-- page 163--><a name="page163"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
163</span>show themselves, and others are apparently thinner than usual; as
the white-throat, the black-cap, the red-start, the fly-catcher.&nbsp; I 
well remember that after the very severe spring in the year 1739-40, summer
birds of passage were very scarce.&nbsp; They come probably hither with a 
south-east wind, or when it blows between those points: but in that 
unfavourable year the winds blowed the whole spring and summer through from
the opposite quarters.&nbsp; And yet amidst all these disadvantages two 
swallows, as I mentioned in my last, appeared this year as early as the 
11th April amidst frost and snow; but they withdrew again for a time.</p>
<p>I am not pleased to find that some people seem so little satisfied with 
Scopoli&rsquo;s new publication; there is room to expect great things from 
the hands of that man, who is a good naturalist: and one would think that a
history of the birds of so distant and southern a region as Carniola would 
be new and interesting.&nbsp; I could wish to see that work, and hope to 
get it sent down.&nbsp; Dr. Scopoli is physician to the wretches that work 
in the quicksilver mines of that district.</p>
<p>When you talked of keeping a reed-sparrow, and giving it seeds, I could 
not help wondering; because the reed-sparrow which I mentioned to you 
(<i>Passer arundinaceus minor Raii</i>) is a soft-billed bird; and most 
probably migrates hence before winter; whereas <!-- page 164--><a 
name="page164"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 164</span>the bird you kept 
(<i>Passer torquatus Raii</i>) abides all the year, and is a thick-billed 
bird.&nbsp; I question whether the latter be much of a songster; but in 
this matter I want to be better informed.&nbsp; The former has a variety of
hurrying notes, and sings all night.&nbsp; Some part of the song of the 
former, I suspect, is attributed to the latter.&nbsp; We have plenty of the
soft-billed sort; which Mr. Pennant had entirely left out of his 
&ldquo;British Zoology,&rdquo; till I reminded him of his omission.&nbsp; 
See &ldquo;British Zoology&rdquo; last published, p. 16.</p>
<p>I have somewhat to advance on the different manners in which different 
birds fly and walk; but as this is a subject that I have not enough 
considered, and is of such a nature as not to be contained in a small 
space, I shall say nothing further about it at present.</p>
<p>No doubt the reason why the sex of birds in their first plumage is so 
difficult to be distinguished is, as you say, &ldquo;because they are not 
to pair and discharge their parental functions till the ensuing 
spring.&rdquo;&nbsp; As colours seem to be the chief external sexual 
distinction in many birds, these colours do not take place till sexual 
attachments begin to obtain.&nbsp; And the case is the same in quadrupeds; 
among whom, in their younger days, the sexes differ but little: but, as 
they advance to maturity, horns and shaggy manes, beards, and brawny necks,
etc., etc., strongly discriminate the male from the female.&nbsp; We may 
instance still farther <!-- page 165--><a name="page165"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 165</span>in our own species, where a beard and stronger
features are usually characteristic of the male sex: but this sexual 
diversity does not take place in earlier life; for a beautiful youth shall 
be so like a beautiful girl that the difference shall not be 
discernible;</p>

<h3>LETTER VII.</h3>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">Ringmer</span> <i>near</i>
<span class="smcap">Lewes</span>, <i>Oct. 8th</i>, 1770.</p>
<p>Dear Sir,&mdash;I am glad to hear that Kuckalm is to furnish you with 
the birds of Jamaica; a sight of the <i>hirundines</i> of that hot and 
distant island would be a great entertainment to me.</p>
<p>The Anni of Scopoli are now in my possession; and I have read the 
<i>Annus Primus</i> with satisfaction; for though some parts of this work 
are exceptionable, and he may advance some mistaken observations, yet the 
ornithology of so distant a country as Carniola is very <!-- page 166--><a 
name="page166"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 166</span>curious.&nbsp; Men 
that undertake only one district are much more likely to advance natural 
knowledge than those that grasp at more than they can possibly be 
acquainted with: every kingdom, every province, should have its own 
monographer.</p>
<p>The reason perhaps why he mentions nothing of Ray&rsquo;s Ornithology 
may be the extreme poverty and distance of his country into which the works
of our great naturalist may have never yet found their way.&nbsp; You have 
doubts, I know, whether this Ornithology is genuine, and really the work of
Scopoli; as to myself I think I discover strong tokens of authenticity; the
style corresponds with that of his Entomology; and his characters of his 
Ordines and Genera are many of them new, expressive, and masterly.&nbsp; He
has ventured to alter some of the Linn&aelig;an genera with sufficient show
of reason.</p>
<p>It might perhaps be mere accident that you saw so many swifts and no 
swallows at Staines; because, in my long observation of those birds, I 
never could discover the least degree of rivalry or hostility between the 
species.</p>
<p>Ray remarks that birds of the <i>gallin&oelig;</i> order, as cocks and 
hens, partridges, and pheasants, etc., are <i>pulveratrices</i>, such as 
dust themselves, using that method of cleansing their feathers, and ridding
themselves of their vermin.&nbsp; As far as I can observe, many birds <!-- 
page 167--><a name="page167"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 167</span>that 
dust themselves never wash; and I once thought that those birds that wash 
themselves would never dust; but here I find myself mistaken: for common 
house-sparrows are great pulveratrices, being frequently seen grovelling 
and wallowing in dusty roads; and yet they are great washers.&nbsp; Does 
not the skylark dust?</p>
<p><i>Query</i>.&mdash;Might not Mahomet and his followers take one method 
of purification from these pulveratrices? because I find from travellers of
credit, that if a strict Mussulman is journeying in a sandy desert where no
water is to be found, at stated hours he strips off his clothes, and most 
scrupulously rubs his body over with sand or dust.</p>
<p>A countryman told me he had found a young fern-owl in the nest of a 
small bird on the ground; and that it was fed by the little bird.&nbsp; I 
went to see this extraordinary phenomenon, and found that it was a young 
cuckoo hatched in the nest of a titlark; it was become vastly too big for 
its nest, appearing</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;. . . . . in tenui re<br />
Majores pennas nido extendisse . . &rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and was very fierce and pugnacious, pursuing my finger as I teased it, 
for many feet from the nest, and sparring and buffeting with its wings like
a game-cock.&nbsp; The dupe of a dam appeared at a distance, hovering <!-- 
page 168--><a name="page168"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 168</span>about 
with meat in its mouth, and expressing the greatest solicitude.</p>
<p>In July I saw several cuckoos skimming over a large pond; and found, 
after some observation, that they were feeding on the 
<i>Libellul&aelig;</i> or dragon-flies; some of which they caught as they 
settled on the weeds, and some as they were on the wing.&nbsp; 
Notwithstanding what Linn&aelig;us says, I cannot be induced to believe 
that they are birds of prey.</p>
<p>This district affords some birds that are hardly ever heard of at 
Selborne.&nbsp; In the first place considerable flocks of cross-beaks 
(<i>Loxi&aelig; curvirostr&aelig;</i>) have appeared this summer in the 
pine-groves belonging to this house; the water-ouzel is said to haunt the 
mouth of the Lewes river, near Newhaven; and the Cornish chough builds, I 
know, all along the chalky cliffs of the Sussex shore.</p>
<p>I was greatly pleased to see little parties of ring-ouzels (my newly 
discovered migrators) scattered, at intervals, all along the Sussex downs, 
from Chichester to Lewes.&nbsp; Let them come from whence they will, it 
looks very suspicious that they are cantoned along the coast in order to 
pass the channel when severe weather advances.&nbsp; They visit us again in
April, as it should seem, in their return; and are not to be found in the 
dead of winter.&nbsp; It is remarkable that they are very tame, and seem to
have no manner of apprehensions of <!-- page 169--><a 
name="page169"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 169</span>danger from a person 
with a gun.&nbsp; There are bustards on the wide downs near 
Brighthelmstone.&nbsp; No doubt you are acquainted with the Sussex downs; 
the prospects and rides round Lewes are most lovely!</p>
<p>As I rode along near the coast I kept a very sharp look-out in the lanes
and woods, hoping I might, at this time of the year, have discovered some 
of the summer short-winged birds of passage crowding towards the coast in 
order for their departure: but it was very extraordinary that I never saw a
red-start, white-throat, black-cap, uncrested wren, fly-catcher, etc.&nbsp;
And I remember to have made the same remark in former years, as I usually 
come to this place annually about this time.&nbsp; The birds most common 
along the coast, at present, are the stone-chatters, whinchats, buntings, 
linnets, some few wheatears, titlarks, etc.&nbsp; Swallows and 
house-martins abound yet, induced to prolong their stay by this soft, 
still, dry season.</p>
<p>A land tortoise, which has been kept for thirty years in a little walled
court belonging to the house where I now am visiting, retires under ground 
about the middle of November, and comes forth again about the middle of 
April.&nbsp; When it first appears in the spring it discovers very little 
inclination towards food; but in the height of summer grows voracious; and 
then as the summer declines its appetite declines; so that for the last six
weeks in autumn it hardly eats at all.&nbsp; Milky <!-- page 170--><a 
name="page170"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 170</span>plants, such as 
lettuces, dandelions, sowthistles, are its favourite dish.&nbsp; In a 
neighbouring village one was kept till by tradition it was supposed to be a
hundred years old.&nbsp; An instance of vast longevity in such a poor 
reptile!</p>
<h3>LETTER VIII</h3>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">Selborne</span>, <i>Dec. 
20th</i>, 1770.</p>
<p>Dear Sir,&mdash;The birds that I took for aberdavines were reed-sparrows
(<i>Passeres torquati</i>).</p>
<p>There are doubtless many home internal migrations within this kingdom 
that want to be better understood: witness those vast flocks of 
hen-chaffinches that appear with us in the winter without hardly any cocks 
among them.&nbsp; Now was there a due proportion of each sex, it should 
seem very improbable that any one district should produce such numbers of 
these little birds; and much more when only one-half of the species 
appears; therefore we may conclude that the <i>Fringill&oelig; 
c&oelig;lebes</i>, for some good purposes, have a peculiar migration of 
their own in which the sexes part.&nbsp; Nor should it seem so wonderful 
that the intercourse of sexes in this species of bird should be interrupted
in winter; since in many animals, and particularly in bucks and does, the 
sexes herd separately, except at the season when commerce is necessary for 
the continuance of the breed.&nbsp; For this matter of the chaffinches see 
&ldquo;Fauna Suecica,&rdquo; p. 58, and &ldquo;Systema Natur&aelig;,&rdquo;
p. 318.&nbsp; I see every winter vast flights of hen-chaffinches, but none 
of cocks.</p>
<p>Your method of accounting for the periodical motions of the British 
singing birds, or birds of flight, is a very probable one; since the matter
of food is a great regulator of the actions and proceedings of the brute 
creation; there is but one that can be set in competition with it, and that
is love.&nbsp; But I cannot quite acquiesce with you in one circumstance 
when you advance that, &ldquo;when they have thus feasted, they again 
separate into small parties of five or six, and get the best fare they can 
within a certain district, having no inducement to go in quest of fresh 
turned earth.&rdquo;&nbsp; Now if you mean that the business of 
congregating is quite at an end from the conclusion of wheat sowing to the 
season of barley and oats, it is not the case with us; for larks and 
chaffinches, and particularly linnets, flock and congregate as much in the 
very dead of winter as when the husbandman is busy with his ploughs and 
harrows.</p>
<p>Sure there can be no doubt but that woodcocks and fieldfares leave us in
the spring, in order to cross the seas, and to retire to some districts 
more suitable to the purpose of breeding.&nbsp; That the former pair before
they retire, and that the hens are forward with egg, I myself, when I was a
sportsman, have often experienced.&nbsp; It cannot indeed be denied but 
that now and then we hear of a woodcock&rsquo;s nest, or young birds, 
discovered in some part or other of this island; but then they are all 
always mentioned as rarities, and somewhat out of the common course of 
things: but as to redwings and fieldfares, no sportsman or naturalist has 
ever yet, that I could hear, pretended to have found the nest or young of 
those species in any part of these kingdoms.&nbsp; And I the more admire at
this instance as extraordinary, since, to all appearance, the same food in 
summer as well as in winter might support them here which maintains their 
congeners, the black-birds and thrushes, did they choose to stay the summer
through.&nbsp; From hence it appears that it is not food alone which 
determines some species of birds with regard to their stay or 
departure.&nbsp; Fieldfares or redwings disappear sooner or later according
as the warm weather comes on earlier or later.&nbsp; For I well remember, 
after that dreadful winter 1739-40, that cold north-east winds continued to
blow on through April and May, and that these kind of birds (what few 
remained of them) did not depart as usual, but were seen lingering about 
till the beginning of June.</p>
<p>The best authority that we can have for the <!-- page 173--><a 
name="page173"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 173</span>nidification of the 
birds above-mentioned in any district, is the testimony of faunists that 
have written professedly the natural history of particular countries.&nbsp;
Now as to the fieldfare, Linn&aelig;us, in his &ldquo;Fauna Suecica,&rdquo;
says of it, that &ldquo;<i>maximis in arboribus nidificat</i>;&rdquo; and 
of the redwing he says, in the same place, that &ldquo;<i>nidificat in 
mediis arbusculis</i>, <i>sive sepibus</i>; <i>ova sex 
c&oelig;ruleo-viridia maculis nigris variis</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Hence we may 
be assured that fieldfares and redwings build in Sweden.&nbsp; Scopoli 
says, in his &ldquo;Annus Primus,&rdquo; of the woodcock, that 
&ldquo;<i>nupta ad nos venit circa &oelig;quinoctium vernale</i>;&rdquo; 
meaning in Tyrol, of which he is a native.&nbsp; And afterwards he adds 
&ldquo;<i>nidificat in paludibus alpinis: ova ponit</i> 3-5.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
It does not appear from Kramer that woodcocks breed at all in Austria; but 
he says, &ldquo;<i>Avis h&oelig;c septentrionalium provinciarum 
&oelig;stivo tempore incola est</i>; <i>ubi plerumque nidificat</i>.&nbsp; 
<i>Appropinquante hyeme australiores provincias petit</i>; <i>hinc circa 
plenilunium mensis Octobris plerumque Austriam transmigrat</i>.&nbsp; 
<i>Tunc rursus circa plenilunium potissimum mensis Martii per Austriam 
matrimonio juncta ad septentrionales provincias redit</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; For
the whole passage (which I have abridged) see &ldquo;Elenchus,&rdquo; etc.,
p. 351.&nbsp; This seems to be a full proof of the migration of woodcocks; 
though little is proved concerning the place of breeding.</p>
<p>P.S.&mdash;There fell in the county of Rutland, in three <!-- page 
174--><a name="page174"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 174</span>weeks of 
this present very wet weather, seven inches and a half of rain, which is 
more than has fallen in any three weeks for these thirty years past in that
part of the world.&nbsp; A mean quantity in that county for one year is 
twenty inches and a half.</p>
<h3>LETTER IX.</h3>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">Fyfield</span>, near <span
class="smcap">Andover</span>, <i>Feb. 12th</i>, 1772.</p>
<p>Dear Sir,&mdash;You are, I know, no great friend to migration; and the 
well-attested accounts from various parts of the kingdom seem to justify 
you in your suspicions, that at least many of the swallow kind do not leave
us in the winter, but lay themselves up like insects and bats in a torpid 
state, and slumber away the more uncomfortable months till the return of 
the sun and fine weather awakens them.</p>
<p>But then we must not, I think, deny migration in general; because 
migration certainly does subsist in some places, as my brother in Andalusia
has fully informed me.&nbsp; Of the motions of these birds he has ocular 
demonstration, for many weeks together, both spring and fall; during which 
periods myriads of the swallow kind traverse the straits from north to <!--
page 175--><a name="page175"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 175</span>south, 
and from south to north, according to the season.&nbsp; And these vast 
migrations consist not only of hirundines but of bee-birds, hoopoes, <i>Oro
pendolos</i>, or golden thrushes, etc., etc., and also of many of our 
soft-billed summer birds of passage; and moreover of birds which never 
leave us, such as all the various sorts of hawks and kites.&nbsp; Old 
Belon, two hundred years ago, gives a curious account of the incredible 
armies of hawks and kites which he saw in the spring-time traversing the 
Thracian Bosphorus from Asia to Europe.&nbsp; Besides the above mentioned, 
he remarks that the procession is swelled by whole troops of eagles and 
vultures.</p>
<p>Now it is no wonder that birds residing in Africa should retreat before 
the sun as it advances, and retire to milder regions, and especially birds 
of prey, whose blood being heated with hot animal food, are more impatient 
of a sultry climate; but then I cannot help wondering why kites and hawks, 
and such hardy birds as are known to defy all the severity of England, and 
even of Sweden and all north Europe, should want to migrate from the south 
of Europe, and be dissatisfied with the winters of Andalusia.</p>
<p>It does not appear to me that much stress may be laid on the difficulty 
and hazard that birds must run in their migrations, by reason of vast 
oceans, cross winds, etc.; because, if we reflect, a bird may travel from 
England to the Equator without launching out and <!-- page 176--><a 
name="page176"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 176</span>exposing itself to 
boundless seas, and that by crossing the water at Dover, and again at 
Gibraltar.&nbsp; And I with the more confidence advance this obvious 
remark, because my brother has always found that some of his birds, and 
particularly the swallow kind, are very sparing of their pains in crossing 
the Mediterranean; for when arrived at Gibraltar they do not</p>
<blockquote>
<p>. . . &ldquo;Rang&rsquo;d in figure wedge their way,<br />
. . . . And set forth<br />
Their airy caravan high over seas<br />
Flying, and over lands with mutual wing<br />
Easing their flight:&rdquo; . . . . &mdash;MILTON.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>but scout and hurry along in little detached parties of six or seven in 
a company; and sweeping low, just over the surface of the land and water, 
direct their course to the opposite continent at the narrowest passage they
can find.&nbsp; They usually slope across the bay to the south-west, and so
pass over opposite to Tangier, which, it seems, is the narrowest space.</p>
<p>In former letters we have considered whether it was probable that 
woodcocks in moonshiny nights cross the German ocean from 
Scandinavia.&nbsp; As a proof that birds of less speed may pass that sea, 
considerable as it is, I shall relate the following incident, which, though
mentioned to have happened so many years ago, was strictly matter of 
fact:&mdash;As some people <!-- page 177--><a name="page177"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 177</span>were shooting in the parish of Trotton, in the
county of Sussex, they killed a duck in that dreadful winter, 1708-9, with 
a silver collar about its neck, on which were engraven the arms of the king
of Denmark.&nbsp; This anecdote the rector of Trotton at that time has 
often told to a near relation of mine; and to the best of my remembrance, 
the collar was in the possession of the rector.</p>
<p>At present I do not know anybody near the seaside that will take the 
trouble to remark at what time of the moon woodcocks first come; if I lived
near the sea myself I would soon tell you more of the matter.&nbsp; One 
thing I used to observe when I was a sportsman, that there were times in 
which woodcocks were so sluggish and sleepy that they would drop again when
flushed just before the spaniels, nay, just at the muzzle of a gun that had
been fired at them; whether this strange laziness was the effect of a 
recent fatiguing journey I shall not presume to say.</p>
<p>Nightingales not only never reach Northumberland and Scotland, but also,
as I have been always told, Devonshire and Cornwall.&nbsp; In those two 
last counties we cannot attribute the failure of them to the want of 
warmth; the defect in the west is rather a presumptive argument that these 
birds come over to us from the continent at the narrowest passage, and do 
not stroll so far westward.</p>
<p><!-- page 178--><a name="page178"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
178</span>Let me hear from your own observation whether skylarks do not 
dust.&nbsp; I think they do; and if they do, whether they wash also.</p>
<p>The <i>Alauda pratensis</i> of Ray was the poor dupe that was educating 
the booby of a cuckoo mentioned in my letter of October last.</p>
<p>Your letter came too late for me to procure a ring-ouzel for Mr. Tunstal
during their autumnal visit; but I will endeavour to get him one when they 
call on us again in April.&nbsp; I am glad that you and that gentleman saw 
my Andalusian birds; I hope they answered your expectation.&nbsp; Royston, 
or grey crows, are winter birds that come much about the same time with the
woodcock; they, like the fieldfare and redwing, have no apparent reason for
migration; for as they fare in the winter like their congeners, so might 
they in all appearance in the summer.&nbsp; Was not Tenant, when a boy, 
mistaken? did he not find a missel-thrush&rsquo;s nest, and take it for the
nest of a fieldfare?</p>
<p>The stock-dove, or wood-pigeon, <i>&OElig;nas Raii</i>, is the last 
winter bird of passage which appears with us; it is not seen till towards 
the end of November: about twenty years ago they abounded in the district 
of Selborne; and strings of them were seen morning and evening that reached
a mile or more; but since the beechen woods have been greatly thinned they 
are much decreased in number.&nbsp; The ring-dove, <i>Palumbus</i> <!-- 
page 179--><a name="page179"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
179</span><i>Raii</i>, stays with us the whole year, and breeds several 
times through the summer.</p>
<p>Before I received your letter of October last I had just remarked in my 
journal that the trees were unusually green.&nbsp; This uncommon verdure 
lasted on late into November; and may be accounted for from a late spring, 
a cool and moist summer; but more particularly from vast armies of chafers,
or tree-beetles, which, in many places, reduced whole woods to a leafless 
naked state.&nbsp; These trees shot again at Midsummer, and then retained 
their foliage till very late in the year.</p>
<p>My musical friend, at whose house I am now visiting, has tried all the 
owls that are his near neighbours with a pitch-pipe set at concert pitch, 
and finds they all hoot in B flat.&nbsp; He will examine the nightingales 
next spring.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">I am, etc., etc.</p>
<h3>LETTER X.</h3>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">Selborne</span>, <i>Aug. 
1st.</i>, 177l.</p>
<p>Dear Sir,&mdash;From what follows, it will appear that neither owls nor 
cuckoos keep to one note.&nbsp; A friend remarks that many (most) of his 
owls hoot in B flat; <!-- page 180--><a name="page180"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 180</span>but that one went almost half a note below 
A.&nbsp; The pipe he tried their notes by was a common half-crown 
pitch-pipe, such as masters use for tuning of harpsichords; it was the 
common London pitch.</p>
<p>A neighbour of mine, who is said to have a nice ear, remarks that the 
owls about this village hoot in three different keys, in G flat, or F 
sharp, in B flat and A flat.&nbsp; He heard two hooting to each other, the 
one in A flat, and the other in B flat.&nbsp; <i>Query</i>: Do these 
different notes proceed from different species, or only from various 
individuals?&nbsp; The same person finds upon trial that the note of the 
cuckoo (of which we have but one species) varies in different individuals; 
for, about Selborne wood, he found they were mostly in D: he heard two sing
together, the one in D, the other in D sharp, who made a disagreeable 
concert: he afterwards heard one in D sharp, and about Wolmer Forest some 
in C.&nbsp; As to nightingales, he says that their notes are so short, and 
their transitions so rapid, that he cannot well ascertain their key.&nbsp; 
Perhaps in a cage, and in a room, their notes may be more 
distinguishable.&nbsp; This person has tried to settle the notes of a 
swift, and of several other small birds, but cannot bring them to any 
criterion.</p>
<p>As I have often remarked that redwings are some of the first birds that 
suffer with us in severe weather, it is no wonder at all that they retreat 
from Scandinavian <!-- page 181--><a name="page181"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 181</span>winters: and much more the <i>ordo</i> of 
<i>grall&oelig;</i>, who, all to a bird, forsake the northern parts of 
Europe at the approach of winter.&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>Grall&aelig; tanquam 
conjurat&aelig;</i>, <i>unanimiter in fugam se cojiciunt</i>; <i>ne earum 
unicam quidem inter nos habitantem invenire possimus</i>; <i>ut enim 
&aelig;state in australibus degere nequeunt ob defectum lumbricorum</i>, 
<i>terramque siccam</i>; <i>ita nec in frigidis ob eandem 
causam</i>,&rdquo; says Ekmarck the Swede, in his ingenious little treatise
called &ldquo;Migrationes Avium,&rdquo; which by all means you ought to 
read while your thoughts run on the subject of migration.&nbsp; See 
&ldquo;Am&oelig;nitates Academic&aelig;,&rdquo; vol. iv., p. 565.</p>
<p>Birds may be so circumstanced as to be obliged to migrate in one 
country, and not in another: but the <i>grall&aelig;</i> (which procure 
their food from marshes and boggy grounds), must in winter forsake the more
northerly parts of Europe, or perish for want of food.</p>
<p>I am glad you are making inquiries from Linn&aelig;us concerning the 
woodcock; it is expected of him that he should be able to account for the 
motions and manner of life of the animals of his own 
&ldquo;Fauna.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Faunists, as you observe, are too apt to acquiesce in bare descriptions,
and a few synonyms: the reason is plain; because all that may be done at 
home in a man&rsquo;s study, but the investigation of the life and 
conversation of animals, is a concern of much more trouble and difficulty, 
and is not to be attained but by the active <!-- page 182--><a 
name="page182"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 182</span>and inquisitive, and 
by those that reside much in the country.</p>
<p>Foreign systematics are, I observe, much too vague in their specific 
differences, which are almost universally constituted by one or two 
particular marks, the rest of the description running in general 
terms.&nbsp; But our countryman, the excellent Mr. Ray, is the only 
describer that conveys some precise idea in every term or word, maintaining
his superiority over his followers and imitators in spite of the advantage 
of fresh discoveries and modern information.</p>
<p>At this distance of years it is not in my power to recollect at what 
periods woodcocks used to be sluggish or alert when I was a sportsman: but,
upon my mentioning this circumstance to a friend, he thinks he has observed
them to be remarkably listless against snowy foul weather; if this should 
be the case, then the inaptitude for flying arises only from an eagerness 
for food; as sheep are observed to be very intent on grazing against stormy
wet evenings.</p>

183</span>LETTER XI.</h3>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">Selborne</span>, <i>Feb. 
8th</i>, 1772.</p>
<p>Dear Sir,&mdash;When I ride about in the winter, and see such prodigious
flocks of various kinds of birds, I cannot help admiring at these 
congregations, and wishing that it was in my power to account for those 
appearances almost peculiar to the season.&nbsp; The two great motives 
which regulate the proceedings of the brute creation are love and hunger; 
the former incites animals to perpetuate their kind; the latter induces 
them to preserve individuals: whether either of these should seem to be the
ruling passion in the matter of congregating is to be considered.&nbsp; As 
to love, that is out of the question at a time of the year when that soft 
passion is not indulged: besides, during the amorous season, such a 
jealousy prevails between the male birds that they can hardly bear to be 
together in the same hedge or field.&nbsp; Most of the singing and elation 
of spirits of that time seem to me to be the effect of rivalry and 
emulation: and it is to this spirit of jealousy that I chiefly attribute 
the equal dispersion of birds in the spring over the face of the 
country.</p>
<p>Now as to the business of food: as these animals are actuated by 
instinct to hunt for necessary food, <!-- page 184--><a 
name="page184"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 184</span>they should not, one 
would suppose, crowd together in pursuit of sustenance at a time when it is
most likely to fail; yet such associations do take place in hard weather 
chiefly, and thicken as the severity increases.&nbsp; As some kind of 
self-interest and self-defence is no doubt the motive for the proceeding, 
may it not arise from the helplessness of their state in such rigorous 
seasons; as men crowd together, when under great calamities, though they 
know not why.&nbsp; Perhaps approximation may dispel some degree of cold, 
and a crowd may make each individual appear safer from the ravages of birds
of prey and other dangers.</p>
<p>If I admire when I see how much congenerous birds love to congregate, I 
am the more struck when I see incongruous ones in such strict amity.&nbsp; 
If we do not much wonder to see a flock of rooks usually attended by a 
train of daws, yet it is strange that the former should so frequently have 
a flight of starlings for their satellites.&nbsp; Is it because rooks have 
a more discerning scent than their attendants, and can lead them to spots 
more productive of food?&nbsp; Anatomists say that rooks, by reason of two 
large nerves which run down between the eyes into the upper mandible, have 
a more delicate feeling in their beaks than other round-billed birds, and 
can grope for their meat when out of sight.&nbsp; Perhaps, then, their 
associates attend them on the motive of interest, as greyhounds wait on the
<!-- page 185--><a name="page185"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
185</span>motions of their finders, and as lions are said to do on the 
yelpings of jackals.&nbsp; Lapwings and starlings sometimes associate.</p>
<h3>LETTER XII.</h3>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>March 9th</i>, 1772.</p>
<p>Dear Sir,&mdash;As a gentleman and myself were walking on the 4th of 
last November, round the sea-banks at Newhaven, near the mouth of the Lewes
river, in pursuit of natural knowledge, we were surprised to see three 
house-swallows gliding very swiftly by us.&nbsp; That morning was rather 
chilly, with the wind at north-west; but the tenor of the weather for some 
time before had been delicate, and the noons remarkably warm.&nbsp; From 
this incident, and from repeated accounts which I meet with, I am more and 
more induced to believe that many of the swallow kind do not depart from 
this island, but lay themselves up in holes and caverns, and do, 
insect-like and bat-like, come forth at mild times, and then retire again 
to their <i>latebr&oelig;</i>.&nbsp; Nor make I the least doubt but that, 
if I lived at Newhaven, Seaford, Brighthelmstone, or any of those towns 
near the chalk cliffs of the Sussex coast, by proper <!-- page 186--><a 
name="page186"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 186</span>observations, I 
should see swallows stirring at periods of the winter, when the noons were 
soft and inviting, and the sun warm and invigorating.&nbsp; And I am the 
more of this opinion from what I have remarked during some of our late 
springs, that though some swallows did make their appearance about the 
usual time, viz., the 13th or 14th April, yet meeting with a harsh 
reception, and blustering cold north-east winds, they immediately withdrew,
absconding for several days, till the weather gave them better 
encouragement.</p>
<h3>LETTER XIII.</h3>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>April 12th</i>, 1772.</p>
<p>Dear Sir,&mdash;While I was in Sussex last autumn, my residence was at 
the village near Lewes, from whence I had formerly the pleasure of writing 
to you.&nbsp; On the 1st November I remarked that the old tortoise, 
formerly mentioned, began first to dig the ground in order to the forming 
its hybernaculum, which it had fixed on just beside a great tuft of 
hepaticas.&nbsp; It scrapes out the ground with its fore-feet, and throws 
it up over its back with its hind; but the motion of its legs is 
ridiculously slow, little exceeding the hour-hand <!-- page 187--><a 
name="page187"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 187</span>of a clock, and 
suitable to the composure of an animal said to be a whole month in 
performing one feat of copulation.&nbsp; Nothing can be more assiduous than
this creature night and day in scooping the earth, and forcing its great 
body into the cavity; but, as the noons of that season proved unusually 
warm and sunny, it was continually interrupted, and called forth by the 
heat in the middle of the day; and though I continued there till the 13th 
November, yet the work remained unfinished.&nbsp; Harsher weather, and 
frosty mornings, would have quickened its operations.&nbsp; No part of its 
behaviour ever struck me more than the extreme timidity it always expresses
with regard to rain; for though it has a shell that would secure it against
the wheel of a loaded cart, yet does it discover as much solicitude about 
rain as a lady dressed in all her best attire, shuffling away on the first 
sprinklings, and running its head up in a corner.&nbsp; If attended to, it 
becomes an excellent weather-glass, for as sure as it walks elate, and as 
it were on tiptoe, feeding with great earnestness in a morning, so sure 
will it rain before night.&nbsp; It is totally a diurnal animal, and never 
pretends to stir after it becomes dark.&nbsp; The tortoise, like other 
reptiles, has an arbitrary stomach as well as lungs; and can refrain from 
eating as well as breathing for a great part of the year.&nbsp; When first 
awakened it eats nothing, nor again in the autumn before it retires; <!-- 
page 188--><a name="page188"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 188</span>through
the height of the summer it feeds voraciously, devouring all the food that 
comes in its way.&nbsp; I was much taken with its sagacity in discerning 
those that do it kind offices; for, as soon as the good old lady comes in 
sight who has waited on it for more than thirty years, it hobbles towards 
its benefactress with awkward alacrity, but remains inattentive to 
strangers.&nbsp; Thus, not only &ldquo;the ox knoweth his owner, and the 
ass his master&rsquo;s crib,&rdquo; but the most abject reptile and torpid 
of beings distinguishes the hand that feeds it, and is touched with the 
feelings of gratitude!</p>
<p style="text-align: right">I am, etc., etc.</p>
<p>P.S.&mdash;In about three days after I left Sussex, the tortoise retired
into the ground under the hepatica.</p>
<h3>LETTER XIV.</h3>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">Selborne</span>, <i>March 
26th</i>, 1773.</p>
<p>Dear Sir,&mdash;The more I reflect on the 
&sigma;&tau;&omicron;&rho;&gamma;&eta; of animals, the more I am astonished
at its effects.&nbsp; Nor is the violence of this affection more wonderful 
than the shortness of its duration.&nbsp; Thus every hen is in her turn the
virago of the yard, in proportion to the <!-- page 189--><a 
name="page189"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 189</span>helplessness of her 
brood, and will fly in the face of a dog or a sow in defence of those 
chickens, which in a few weeks she will drive before her with relentless 
cruelty.</p>
<p>This affection sublimes the passions, quickens the invention, and 
sharpens the sagacity of the brute creation.&nbsp; Thus a hen, just become 
a mother, is no longer that placid bird she used to be, but with feathers 
standing on end, wings hovering, and clocking note, she runs about like one
possessed.&nbsp; Dams will throw themselves in the way of the greatest 
danger in order to avert it from their progeny.&nbsp; Thus a partridge will
tumble along before a sportsman in order to draw away the dogs from her 
helpless covey.&nbsp; In the time of nidification the most feeble birds 
will assault the most rapacious.&nbsp; All the hirundines of a village are 
up in arms at the sight of a hawk, whom they will persecute till he leaves 
that district.&nbsp; A very exact observer has often remarked that a pair 
of ravens nesting in the rock of Gibraltar, would suffer no vulture or 
eagle to rest near their station, but would drive them from the hill with 
an amazing fury; even the blue thrush at the season of breeding would dart 
out from the clefts of the rocks to chase away the kestril, or the 
sparrow-hawk.&nbsp; If you stand near the nest of a bird that has young, 
she will not be induced to betray them by an inadvertent fondness, but will
<!-- page 190--><a name="page190"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
190</span>wait about at a distance with meat in her mouth for an hour 
together.</p>
<p>Should I farther corroborate what I have advanced above by some 
anecdotes which I probably may have mentioned before in conversation, yet 
you will, I trust, pardon the repetition for the sake of the 
illustration.</p>
<p>The fly-catcher of the &ldquo;Zoology&rdquo; (the <i>Stoparola</i> of 
Ray), builds every year in the vines that grow on the walls of my 
house.&nbsp; A pair of these little birds had one year inadvertently placed
their nest on a naked bough, perhaps in a shady time, not being aware of 
the inconvenience that followed.&nbsp; But a hot sunny season coming on 
before the brood was half fledged, the reflection of the wall became 
insupportable, and must inevitably have destroyed the tender young, had not
affection suggested an expedient, and prompted the parent birds to hover 
over the nest all the hotter hours, while with wings expanded, and mouths 
gaping for breath, they screened off the heat from their suffering 
offspring.</p>
<p>A farther instance I once saw of notable sagacity in a willow-wren, 
which had built in a bank in my fields.&nbsp; This bird a friend and myself
had observed as she sat in her nest; but were particularly careful not to 
disturb her, though we saw she eyed us with some degree of jealousy.&nbsp; 
Some days after, as we passed that way, we were desirous of remarking how 
this <!-- page 191--><a name="page191"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
191</span>brood went on, but no nest could be found, till I happened to 
take a large bundle of long green moss, as it were, carelessly thrown over 
the nest in order to dodge the eye of any impertinent intruder.</p>
<p>A still more remarkable mixture of sagacity and instinct occurred to me 
one day as my people were pulling off the lining of a hot-bed, in order to 
add some fresh dung.&nbsp; From out of the side of this bed leaped an 
animal with great agility, that made a most grotesque figure; nor was it 
without great difficulty that it could be taken, when it proved to be a 
large white-bellied field-mouse with three or four young clinging to her 
teats by their mouths and feet.&nbsp; It was amazing that the desultory and
rapid motions of this dam should not oblige her litter to quit their hold, 
especially when it appeared that they were so young as to be both naked and
blind!</p>
<p>To these instances of tender attachment, many more of which might be 
daily discovered by those that are studious of nature, may be opposed that 
rage of affection, that monstrous perversion of the 
&sigma;&tau;&omicron;&rho;&gamma;&eta;, which induces some females of the 
brute creation to devour their young because their owners have handled them
too freely, or removed them from place to place!&nbsp; Swine, and sometimes
the more gentle race of dogs and cats, are guilty of this horrid and 
preposterous murder.&nbsp; When I hear now and then of an abandoned mother 
<!-- page 192--><a name="page192"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
192</span>that destroys her offspring, I am not so much amazed, since 
reason perverted, and the bad passions let loose, are capable of any 
enormity; but why the parental feelings of brutes, that usually flow in one
most uniform tenor should sometimes be so extravagantly diverted, I leave 
to abler philosophers than myself to determine.</p>

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
